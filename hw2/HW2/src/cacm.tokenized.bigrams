The

The+Choice
Binary+Representation
.W
The
binary
number
system
offers
many
advantages
over
a
decimal
representation
for
a
high
-
performance
,
general
-
purpose
computer
.
The
greater
simplicity
of
a
binary
arithmetic
unit
and
the
greater
compactness
of
binary
numbers
both
contribute
directly
to
arithmetic
speed
.
Less
obvious
and
perhaps
more
important
is
the
way
binary
addressing
and
instruction
formats
can
increase
the
overall
performance
.
Binary
addresses
are
also
essential
to
certain
powerful
operations
which
are
not
practical
with
decimal
instruction
formats
.
On
the
other
hand
,
decimal
numbers
are
essential
for
communicating
between
man
and
the
computer
.
In
applications
requiring
the
processing
of
a
large
volume
of
inherently
decimal
input
and
output
data
,
the
time
for
decimal
-
binary
conversion
needed
by
a
purely
binary
computer
may
be
significant
.
A
slower
decimal
adder
may
take
less
time
than
a
fast
binary
adder
doing
an
addition
and
two
conversions
.

Feasibility+Considerations
.W
The
tendency
towards
increased
parallelism
in
computers
is
noted
.
Exploitation
of
this
parallelism
presents
a
number
of
new
problems
in
machine
design
and
in
programming
systems
.
Minimum
requirements
for
successful
concurrent
execution
of
several
independent
problem
programs
are
discussed
.
These
requirements
are
met
in
the
STRETCH
system
by
a
carefully
balanced
combination
of
built
-
in
and
programmed
logic
.
Techniques
are
described
which
place
the
burden
of
the
programmed
logic
on
system
programs
(
supervisory
program
and
compiler
)
rather
than
on
problem
programs

.W
In
this
communication
the
use
of
a
shift

register
code
with
n
=
10
is
described
for
calling
64
wireless
telemetering
stations
in
a
fixed
cyclical
order
.
A
high
degree
of
redundancy
is
used
,
permitting
a

to
be
employed
as
the
station

code
.
Embedding
this
in
the

code
with
period

permits
the
code
to
be
employed
without

,
each

Proposal
for
a
Feasible
Programming
System
Feasible+Programming
Programming+System
.W
This
paper
proposes
designing
a
programming
facility
(
itself
involving
a
digital
computer
and
a
program
)
which
will
assist
the
preparation
of
large
-
scale
real
-
time
programs
.
This
facility
is
to
be
capable
of
preparing
programs
for
any
of
a
variety
of
machines
having
characteristics
similar
to
those
of
the
facility
's
computer
.
One
of
the
basic
assumptions
is
that
there
will
be
enough
random
-
access
storage
available
to
avoid
the
necessity
for
segmenting
a
constructed
program
in
any
fashion
other
than
a
trivial
one
.
While
this
assumption
is
somewhat
unrealistic
,
it
is
intended
to
provide
an
opportunity
to
concentrate
on
the
other
aspects
of
program
construction
.
The
programming
system
should
stress
the
discovery
in
source
program
statements
of
as
many
errors
as
possible
,
before
attempting
to
construct
an
object
program
.
Among
the
computer
characteristics
which
are
advocated
are
a
program
interrupt
scheme
,
a
large
set
of
characters
,
and
indirect
addressing
.

This
paper
is
concerned
with
the
practical
solution
of
characteristic
value
problem
for
an
ordinary
differential
equation
.
It
is
at
once
apparent
that
sequential
computers
,
be
they
digital
or
analog
,
solve
initial
value
problems
,
rather
than
boundary
value
problems
,
and
some
mathematical
process
must
be
found
to
compensate
for
the
machine
's
inadequacy
.
(
Compensating
for
machine
imperfection
is
,
of
course
,
the
normal
activity
of
the
numerical
analyst
.
)
A
number
of
other
papers
have
applied
particular
devices
to
particular

.
The
purpose
of
this
note
is
to
establish
a
mathematical
framework
or
model
for
these
practical
procedures
and
thus
assist
in
the
use
and
extension
of
the
ideas
in
other
particular

The

Programing
a

some
techniques

A
Method
for
Overlapping

Erasure
of
Lists
A+Method
.W
An
important
property
of
the
Newell
-
Shaw
-
Simon
scheme
for
computer
storage
of
lists
is
that
data
having
multiple
occurrences
need
not
be
stored
at
more
than
one
place
in
the
computer
.
That
is
,
lists
may
be
"
overlapped
.
"
Unfortunately
,
overlapping
poses
a
problem
for
subsequent
erasure
.
Given
a
list
that
is
no
longer
needed
,
it
is
desired
to
erase
just
those
parts
that
do
not
overlap
other
lists
.
In
LISP
,
McCarthy
employs
an
elegant
but
inefficient
solution
to
the
problem
.
The
present
paper
describes
a
general
method
which
enables
efficient
erasure
.
The
method
employs
interspersed
reference
counts
to
describe
the
extent
of
the
overlapping
.

has
uncovered
no
reference

In
order
to
exploit
fully
a
fast
computer
which
possesses
simultaneous
processing
abilities
,
it
should
to
a
large
extent
schedule
its
own
workload
.
The
scheduling
routine
must
be
capable
of
extremely
rapid
execution
if
it
is
not
to
prove
self
-
defeating
.
The
construction
of
a
schedule
entails
determining
which
programs
are
to
be
run
concurrently
and
which
sequentially
with
respect
to
each
other
.
A
concise
scheduling
algorithm
is
described
which
tends
to
minimize
the
time
for
executing
the
entire
pending
workload
(
or
any
subset
of
it
)
,
subject
to
external
constraints
such
as
precedence
,
urgency
,
etc
.
The
algorithm
is
applicable
to
a
wide
class
of
machines
.

A

in
a
format
similar
to
a
computer
program
makes
the
system
convenient
to
use

is
conveniently
described

Dimensional

.W
The
paper
introduces
a
new
family
of
codes
for
detecting
and
correcting
multiple
errors
in
a
binary
-
coded
message
.
The
message
itself
is
arranged
(
conceptually
)
into
a
multidimensional
rectangular
array
.
The
processes
of
encoding
and
error
detection
are
based
upon
parity
evaluations
along
prescribed
dimensions
of
the
array
.
Effectiveness
of
the
codes
is
increased
by
introducing
a
"
system
check
bit
"
,
which
is
essentially
a
parity
check
on
the
other
parity
bits
.
Only
three
-
dimensional
codes
are
discussed
in
this
paper
with
parity
evaluations
along
the
horizontal
,
the
vertical
,
and
one
main
diagonal
.
However
,
the
family
of
codes
is
not
restricted
to
three
dimensions
,
as
evidenced
by
the
discussion
by
Minnick
and
Ashenhurst
on
a
similar
multidimensional
single
-
bit
selection
plan
used
for
another
purpose
[
6
]
.
A
four
-
dimensional
code
,
correcting
three
and
detecting
four
errors
,
has
been
developed
;
the
extension
to
higher
-
dimensional
codes
with
greater
correction
power
is
straightforward
.

Prior
to
and
during
the
1961
Western
Joint
Computer
Conference
,
several
people
in
the
Joint
Users
Groups
had
expressed
interest
in
defining
a
"
smalgol
"
language
.
This
is
to
be
an
ALGOL
language
for
use
with
compilers
on
relatively
small
size
computers
.
A
preliminary
report
resulted
.
At
the
ACM
National
Conference
four
months
later
,
after
considering
several
counter
proposals
,
a
final
version
was
agreed
upon
by
a
subcommittee
.
The
recommendations
of
the
Subcommittee
for
a
standard
subset
of
ALGOL
60
for
use
on
small
computers
is
presented
here

.W
Formalization
of
a
general
computer
storage
allocation
process
is
attempted
.
With
a
given
computer
M
is
associated
a
fictitious
computer
M
'
essentially
identical
to
M
except
in
respect
to
possession
of
unbounded
primary
storage
.
Mappings
of
the
total
storage
set
(
internal
and
external
)
of
M
into
the
direct
address
set
of
M
'
are
introduced
.
A
program
sequence
P
for
M
'
is
termed
M
-
admissible
(
relative
to
a
specific
execution
time
period
)
if
there
is
a
mapping
underwhich
P
and
its
effective
data
referents
are
all
located
in
the
direct
address
set
of
M
.
Storage
allocation
is
considered
as
a
process
of
establishing
for
an
arbitrary
M
'
program
a
sequence
of
mappings
,
a
decoupling
of
the
program
into
M
-
admissible
subprograms
and
a
linking
set
of
interludes
.
An
existence
proof
in
terms
of
a
completely
interpretive
M
program
as
indicated
.
Some
special
cases
are
discussed
.
Various
restrictions
on
generality
of
M
'
programs
are
considered
under
which
more
practical
realization
of
allocation
processes
becomes
tractable
.

Optimum

.W
Consider
a
magnetic
tape
system
with
a
read
check
after
writing
.
Where
an
error
occurs
in
writing
a
record
,
a
programmed
error
routine
may
either
bypass
some
or
all
of
the
area
on
tape
or
try
to
rewrite
the
record
on
the
same
area
.
This
paper
evaluates
these
two
procedures
on
the
basis
of
expected
loss
of
computer
time
and
develops
a
decision
rule
for
selecting
the
optimum
procedure
.
The
rule
depends
critically
on
the
number
of
times
the
tape
being
written
will
be
used
in
the
future
.
In
the
case
where
the
optimum
procedure
is
to
bypass
an
area
,
a
second
decision
-
the
size
of
the
area
to
be
bypassed
-
is
necessary
.
A
formula
is
developed
to
determine
the
optimum
area
to
be
bypassed
for
each
procedure

The
class
of
iteration
formulas
obtainable
by
rational
approximations
of
"
Euler
's
formula
"
is
derived
with
the
corresponding
error
estimates
.
Some
historical
notes
on
iterative
procedures
are
followed
by
a
derivation
of
Euler
's
formula
with
the
associated
error
estimate
in
a
new
notation
which
simplifies
the
error
estimate
and
suggests
generalizations
.
The
final
section
considers
the
Pade
approximants
to
the
"
Euler
polynomial
"
and
shows
how
a
number
of
known
formulas
may
be
derived
from
this
unified
approach
.
There
is
a
short
discussion
of
the
"

Logic
tables
are
an
excellent
way
of
developing
and
expressing
the
logic
required
in
procedures
,
operations
,
systems
and
circuits
.
A
set
of
rules
for
writing
and
using
logic
tables
is
explained
by
means
of
some
simple
examples
.
Then
the
logic
structure
of
a
vending
machine
is
given
in
which
two
logic
tables
are
used
.
Logic
tables
are
two
-
dimensional
in
nature
,
enabling
us
to
fully
express
and
consider
both
the
sequential
and
parallel
aspects
of
logic
.
They
can
be
compiled
directly
into
a
computer
program
and
so
eliminate
the
need
for
flow
charting
and
hand
coding
.

ALGOL

Confidential
.W
The
ALGOL
60
Report
,
*
when
first
encountered
,
seems
to
describe
a
very
complex
language
which
will
be
difficult
to
learn
.
The
"
metalinguistic
formulae
"
admirably
serve
the
purpose
of
precisely
specifying
a
language
,
but
they
are
certainly
not
very
readable
for
a
beginner
.
However
,
experience
has
shown
that
once
the
report
is
explained
it
is
in
fact
easy
to
learn
ALGOL
and
to
write
algorithms
in
it
.
The
language
is
so
general
and
powerful
it
can
handle
an
enormous
class
of
problems
.
It
is
not
hard
to
learn
those
parts
of
ALGOL
present
in
other
compiler
languages
:
how
to
write
assignment
and
go
to
and
for
statements
,
etc
.
Indeed
,
a
lot
of
the
unnecessary
restrictions
imposed
by
other
compiling
languages
have
finally
been
lifted
.
But
ALGOL
also
allows
many
unobvious
things
to
be
written
,
as
we
will
see
later
,
and
herein
lies
a
problem
:
ALGOL
seems
to
have
become
too
general
.
So
many
restrictions
have
been
lifted
that
a
lot
of
technical
details
crop
up
which
are
hard
to
learn
and
to
use
correctly
.
In
this
paper
some
of
the
more
obscure
features
of
the
language
are
considered
and
their
usefulness
is
discussed
.
Remarks
are
based
on
the
authors
'
interpretations
of
the
ALGOL
60
Report

The
General
Standards
Committee
of
the
SHARE
organization
has
devoted
considerable
effort
to
the
problem
of
operating
a
computer
efficiently
in
view
of
the
growing
number
of
programming
systems
available
.
Each
of
these
programming
systems
has
been
coded
to
utilize
a
fixed
set
of
hardware
components
without
recognizing
the
fact
that
others
may
be
occupying
a
storage
medium
required
by
the
first
.
These
incompatibilities
are
currently
resolved
by
manually
setting
up
the
computer
for
each
system
as
required
.
The
following
set
of
conventions
is
being
considered
to
minimize
computer
set
-
up
time
.
They
are
of
sufficiently
broad
interest
that
we
feel
other
computer
users
should
be
aware
of
them
.

presents
a
new
concept
in

:
the
relative
-
frequency
approach
to
measuring
the
significance
of
words
,

,
and

is
discussed
in
detail
,
as
is
its
application
to
problems
of
automatic

A
Card

A+Card

This
paper
proposes
a
card
format
suitable
for
a
variety
of
reference
files
in
information
processing
.
An
80
-
column
IBM
card
is
divided
into
two
fields
-
reference
material
field
(
columns
1
-
67
)
and
identification
field
(
columns
68
-
80
)
.
The
format
for
the
reference
material
is
flexible
,
while
the
format
for
the
identification
is
rigid
.
The
reference
material
includes
basically
an
index
,
title
,
source
,
class
,
summary
and
cross
reference
for
each
entry
.
The
identification
includes
basically
codes
for
a
matrix
of
descriptors
,
an
entry
number
,
and
the
kind
,
major
interest
,
and
source
of
the
reference
.
The
identification
also
provides
a
choice
to
identify
material
for
personal
as
well
as
general
files
.
Since
this
card
format
is
sufficient
to
identify
the
material
normally
associated
with
reference
files
for
books
,
articles
,
programming
terms
,
hardware
terms
,
equipment
,
machine
systems
,
abbreviations
,
etc
.
,
it
is
suitable
as
a
standard
for
card
reference
files
in
information
processing
.

suggests
that
computer

have
a
responsibility
to
call
for

and
for
achieving
a
favorable
legal

rather
occurs
by
an

we

Special
difficulties
are
encountered
in
devising
reliable
systems
for
searching
and
updating
any
large
files
of
documents
that
must
be
identified
primarily
on
the
basis
of

and
other
personal
particulars
.
The
underlying
problem
is
that
of
making
nearly
maximum
use
of
items
of
identifying
information
that
are
individually
unreliable
but
that
may
collectively
be
of
considerable

Rules
that

generally
to

developed
in

of
the
linkage

into

purposes

These

The

for
obtaining
topological

It
permits
treatment
of
larger
networks
than
can
be
handled
on
present

and
achieves
this
with
greater
efficiency

Although
the
procedure
can

it
is
discussed
in

The
use
of
programmed
digital
computers
as
general
pattern
classification
and
recognition
devices
is
one
phase
of
the
current
lively
interest
in
artificial
intelligence
.
It
is
important
to
choose
a
class
of
signals
which
is
,
at
present
,
undergoing
a
good
deal
of
visual
inspection
by
trained
people
for
the
purpose
of
pattern
recognition
.
In
this
way
comparisons
between
machine
and
human
performance
may
be
obtained
.
A
practical
result
also
serves
as
additional
motivation
.
Clinical
electrocardiograms
make
up
such
a
class
of
signals
.
The
approach
to
the
problem
presented
here
centers
upon
the
use
of
multiple
adaptive
matched
filters
that
classify
normalized
signals
.
The

This
paper
provides
an
account
of
the
Shadow
language
that
is
used
to
describe
syntax
and
of
a
corresponding
subroutine
that
enables
a
computer
to
perform
syntactic
analysis
.
The
input
to
this
subroutine
consists
of
a
string
to
be
analyzed
and
a
description
of
the
syntax
that
is
to
be
used
.
The
syntax
is
expressed
in
the
Shadow
language
.
The
output
consists
of
a
trace
table
that
expresses
the
results
of
the
syntactic
analysis
in
a
tabular
form
.
Several
versions
of
the
subroutine
and
some
associated
programs
have
been
in
use
now
for
over
three
years
.
The
present
account
of
the
language
and
the
subroutine
contains
a
summary
of
material
that
has
been
described
previously
in
unpublished

and
also
some
additional
discussion
of
the
work
in
relation
to
the
more
general
questions
of
problem
-

languages
and

.W
In
the
least
squares
method
for
simultaneous
adjustment
of
several
parameters
,
the
coefficients
of
the
normal
equations
are
the
elements
of
a
symmetric
positive
-
definite
matrix
.
In
order
to
solve
the
normal
equations
and
evaluate
the
precision
measures
of
the
resulting
parameters
,
inversion
of
this
matrix
of
coefficients
is
required
.
Many
available
procedures
for
matrix
inversion
do
not
take
advantage
of
the
symmetry
.
Thus
,
when
programmed
for
a
high
-
speed
computer
,
all
n
^
2
elements
must
be
stored
and
manipulated
,
whereas
only
(
n
+

)
/

of
them
are
independent
.
In
order
to
allow
a
computer
of

handle
a

.W
In
a
recent
paper
,
Bellman
showed
how
dynamic
programming
could
be
used
to
determine
the
solution
to
a
problem
previously
considered
by
Stone
.
The
problem
comprises
the
determination
,
given
N
,
of
the
N
points
of
subdivision
of
a
given
interval
(
a
,
B
)
and
the
corresponding
line
segments
,
that
give
the
best
least
squares
fit
to
a
function
g
(
x
)
in
the
interval
.
Bellman
confined
himself
primarily
to
the
analytical
derivation
,
suggesting
briefly
,
however
,
how
the
solution
of
the
equation
derived
for
each
particular
point
of
subdivision
u
(
i
)
could
be
reduced
to
a
discrete
search
.
In
this
paper
,
the
computational
procedure
is
considered
more
fully
,
and
the
similarities
to
some
of
Stone
's
equations
are
indicated
.
It
is
further
shown
that
an
equation
for
u
(
i
)
involving
no
minimization
may
be
found
.
In
addition
,
it
is
shown
how
Bellman
's
method
may
be
applied
to
the
curve
-
fitting
problem
when
the
additional
constraints
are
added
that
the
ends
of
the
line
segments
must
be
on
the

A
concept
is
defined
as
a
class
of
objects
whose
members
can
be
distinguished
by
processing
its
properties
.
Property
is
defined
to
mean
a
partition
of
the
set
of
all
objects
into
disjoint
classes
.
The
formal
definition
of
a
concept
is
recursive
in
nature
.
A
concept
is
described
by
a
list
structure
.
A
one
-
to
-
one
correspondence
is
established
between
the
recursive
definition
of
a
concept
and
its
description
list
structure
.
Like
the
definition
,
the
description
list
structure
of
a
concept
is
also
built
up
from
elementary
list
structures
by
a
recursive
process
.
The
list
structures
obtained
this
way
are
compared
with
the

discussed
by
the

in

Record
linkage
in
the
updating
of
files
is
accomplished
in
many
establishments
through
the
use
of
a
preassigned
number
,
such
as
payroll
number
,
customer
number
,
or
social
security
number
.
In
vital
and
health
records
,
however
,
a
unique
number
is
generally
not
preassigned
to
an
individual
for
purposes
of
reporting
services
received
to
the
health
department
.
In
order
to
determine
whether
different
physician
reports
refer
to
the
same
individual
,
name
and
other
identification
must
be
compared
.
This
is
a
laborious
operation
which
is
subject
to
various
errors
because
of
name
misspellings
,
changes
of
name
upon
marriage
,
and
other
problems
.
We
are
interested
in
the
maintenance
of
a
psychiatric
case
register
in
Maryland
,
where
many
of
the
reports
from
over
a
hundred
psychiatric
agencies
refer
to
the
same
patient
.
These
records
must
be
linked
in
order
to
provide
unduplicated
counts
of
individuals
under
care
and
longitudinal
records
of
psychiatric
history
.
An
earlier
paper
[
1
]
describes
our
general
procedures
for
register
maintenance
by
use
of
a
digital
computer
(
Honeywell

)
.
Here
we
present
in
more
detail
our
initial
procedures
for
the

in

to
elicit

In
this
note
we
propose
a
method
of
generating
stationary
noise
with
a
prescribed
auto
-
covariance
function
by
digital
methods
.
The
need
for
such
a
technique
often
arises
in
testing
the
performance
of
data
processing
and
engineering
systems
,
where
inputs
corrupted
with
correlated
noise
(
of
a
known
form
)
are
required
.
The
technique
is
quite
simple
and
produces
strict
-
sense
stationary
noise
which
agrees
approximately
with
R
(
t
)
,
the
prescribed
auto
-
covariance
function
(
acf
)
,
over
an
interval
[
-
T
(
0
)
,
T
(
0
)
]
.
The
method
consists
of
approximating
the
spectral
density
by
a
periodic
process
with
spectral
lines
,
and
then
synthesizing
the
periodic
noise
with
random
phases
and
appropriate
amplitudes
.
In
order
to
simplify
discussion
of
the
statistical
properties
of
the
noise
generated
,
the
technique
is
first
presented
in
terms
of
exact
harmonic
analysis
.
In
practice
,
discrete
harmonic
analysis
as
presented
in
the
third
section
is
used
.

If

has

which
are

in

with

(

An

by
an
equation
S
(

=

,
one
frequently
has
the
problem
of
determining
a

of
values
of
the
Ai
which
minimizes
the
sum
of
squares
of
differences
between
observed
and
calculated
values
of
a
distinguished
observable
,
say
Zm
.
If
the

of
the
above
equation
for
Zm
,
Zm
=
N
(
Z1
,

;
A1
,

)
gives
rise
to
a
function
N
which
is
nonlinear
in
the

,
then
one
may
rely
on
a
version
of
Gaussian
regression
[
1,2
]
for
an
iteration
scheme
that
converges
to
a
minimizing
set
of
values
.
It
is

here
that
this

may
be
used
for
the
solution
of

in
matrix
inversion
when
using
the

This
algorithm
has
been
developed
for
linear

codes
;
however
,
it
would
be
valuable
for
the
inversion
of
any
non

dense
matrix
.
The
procedures
described
in

have
been
thoroughly
tested
and
have
been
in
operation
on
the
Esso

for

Substantial
computer
cost
savings
have
been
realized
because
of
this

The
Lewis
Research
Center
has
been
using
various
forms
and
degrees
of
program
simultaneity
in
the
operation
of
its
modified
Sperry
-
Rand
Univac
Scientific
Model
1103
computer
during
the
last
five
years
.
This
simultaneity
has
evolved
from
an
initial
achievement
of
self
-
searching
input
and
output
to
the
automatic
time
sharing
of
independently
coded
problems
.
Several
important
machine
and
program
system
modifications
were
necessary
to
accomplish
this
evolution
.
Several
additional
modifications
,
although
not
required
,
were
added
to
facilitate
ease
of
coding
and
operation
.
All
modifications
had
to
proceed
at
a
relatively
temperate
pace
to
insure
that
the
basic
data
-
reduction
work
load
of
the
computing
center
was
completed
on
schedule
.
Some
educationally
valuable
mistakes
were
made
,
and
their
suggested
cures
often
pointed
the
way
to
useful
future
improvements
or
emphasized
some
of
the
basic
principles
of
a
multiprogramming
system
.
The
material
that
follows
is
a
description
of
the
evolution
of
the
programming
and
hardware
system
which
has
developed
into
the
present
multiprogramming
system
at

Guides

Teaching+COBOL
.W
The
teaching
of
COBOL
can
be
divided
into
three
main
subject
areas
.
They
are
the
syntax
of
COBOL
,
the
use
of
such
syntax
in
solving
any
given
problem
,
and
programming
concepts
.
It
is
generally
accepted
that
some
knowledge
of
the
hardware
and
computer
logic
must
be
possessed
by
the
programmer
.
The
teaching
problem
arises
in
determining
how
thoroughly
a
student
must
know
the
hardware
and
logic
for
that
computer
for
which
he
will
write
COBOL
programs
.
Unfortunately
,
historical
data
concerning
students
'
programming
proficiency
is
almost
non
-
existent
and
,
at
best
,
difficult
to
measure
.
How
then
might
we
approach
solving
this
problem
?

Addressing
Multidimensional
Arrays
Addressing+Multidimensional

A
useful
method
of
representing
a
function
of
n
variables
is
to
consider
the
function
to
assume
its
values
at
selected
points
in
n
-
dimensional
space
.
Although
this
picture
is
of
value
to
the
analyst
,
the
elements
of
an
n
-
dimensional
array
must
exist
in
conventional
storage
as
a
linear
array
or
vector
.
The
means
of
performing
the
transformation
of
a
set
of
indices
locating
on
array
element
in
n
-
space
to
the
location
(
address
)
of
the
element
in
its
storage
vector
is
the
subject
of
this
paper
.
It
is
noted
that
the
index
address
transformation
is
computationally
identical
to
the
conversion
of
a
number
from
a
fixed
to
a
mixed
radix
number
system
.
Several
ways
of
implementing
the
transformation
are
described

Of

requirements
of

,
the
pair
of
requirements
"
easy

and
"
easy

are
not

compatible
.
This
paper
argues
that
readability
can
be
added
automatically
in
the
translation
process
so
that
the
programmer
can
enjoy
the
utmost
economy
of
expression
,
while
for
management
a
full

valid
COBOL
version
is
printed
to
give
all
the
advantages
of
readability

NELIAC

for
several
different
machines
have
been
generated
using
the
original
NELIAC
system
developed
at
the
Naval
Electronics
Laboratory
,
San
Diego
,
in
1958
.
A
basic
"

process
was
used
to
generate
all
but
the
first
,
i
.
e
.
the
systems
were
described
in
the
NELIAC
language
and
generated
by
an
existing
NELIAC
compiler
.
This
experience
has
shown
there
is
no
inherent
difficulty
in
"

"
;
indeed
,
it
pointed
out
many
advantages
in
using
a
POL
for
constructing
programming
systems
.
This
report
presents
the
results
of
a
project
completed
in
May
,
1961
in
which
the
NELIAC
system
was
used
to
generate
a
compiler
for
the
IBM

.
The
1401
compiler
,
which
runs
on
the

and
produces
1401
programs
,
was
described
in
the
NELIAC
language
and
generated
with
7090
NELIAC

.
The
reduction
in

time
and
the
improvement
in

were
very
significant

.W
An
artificial
computer
programming
language
is
proposed
for
describing
the
manipulation
of
strings
of
characters
and
symbols
.
The
concept
of
strings
,
introduced
in
the
ALGOL
60
report
,
is
extended
by
adding
:
(
1
)
the
declaration
of
strings
,
substrings
,
and
string
arrays
with
explicit
lengths
;
(
2
)
the
ability
to
concatenate
and
shift
strings
;
and
(
3
)
the
ranking
of
symbols
for
comparing
stings
in
Boolean
relations
.

Some
Legal
Implications
of
the
Use
of
Computers
in
the
Banking
Business
Some+Legal
Legal+Implications
Banking+Business
.W
The
introduction
of
computers
in
to
the
banking
business
has
a
wide
variety
of
legal
implications
that
merit
careful
attention
at
this
very
early
stage
.
The
industry
is
highly
regulated
by
government
and
,
hence
,
is
subject
to
many
statutes
and
regulations
.
It
also
is
affected
by
important
common
law
rules
established
by
courts
.
The
legal
ramifications
involve
not
only
the
mechanization
itself
,
but
also
the
very
significant
,
economically
attractive
phenomenon
of
off
premises
processing
.
It
is
essential
to
identify
and
provide
for
many
legal
aspects
right
now
,
before
systems
and
practices
crystallize
,
in
order
to
avoid
the
later
impact
of
unanticipated
physical
complications
and
expense
.
The
legal
aspects
of
computerization
in
the
banking
business
are
especially
diverse
.
In
some
states
,
there
might
be
the
basic
question
whether
banks
are
authorized
by
law
to
invest
in
the
new
facilities
,
either
directly
or
through
cooperatives
.
More
challenging
are
questions
relating
to
off
-
premises
processors
,
particularly
with
respect
to
the
obligation
not
to
disclose
information
concerning
a
bank
's
customers
,
the
adequacy
of
fidelity
bond
coverage
,
the
extent
of
liability
for
improper
refusal
to
pay
a
check
,
and
susceptibility
to
regulation
by
government
agencies
.
Also
pertinent
is
the
propriety
of
data
processing
by
banks
for
nonbank
entities
and
particularly
of
the
rendering
of
that
service
without
charge
for
bank
depositors
.

A
series
of
clinical
laboratory
codes
have
been
developed
to
accept
and
store
urin
analysis
,
blood
chemistry
,
and
hematology
test
results
for
automatic
data
processing
.
The
codes
,
although
constructed
as
part
of
a
computerized
hospital
simulation
,
have
been
able
to
handle
the
results
of
every
laboratory
test
that
they
have
encountered
.
The
unique
feature
of
these
codes
is
that
they
can
accept
conventionally
recorded
qualitative
as
well
as
quantitative
test
results
.
Consequently
,
clinical
test
results
need
not
be
arbitrarily
stratified
,
standardized
,
or
altered
in
any
way
to
be
coded
.
This
paper
describes
how
the
codes
were
developed
and
presents
a
listing
of
the
urin
analysis
codes
.
Five
criteria
used
in
developing
the
codes
are
outlined
and
the
problem
of
multiple

is
discussed
.
A
solution

Flexible

,

are
also
discussed
,
along
with

The
paper
concludes
that
even
though
many
problems
remain
unsolved
,
the
next
ten
years
could
witness
the
emergence
of
a
practical
automated
information
system
in

MADCAP
Recent+Improvements
.W
MADCAP
is
a
programming
language
admitting
subscripts
,
superscripts
and
certain
forms
of
displayed
formulas
.
The
basic
implementation
of
this
language
was
described
in

previous

This
paper
discusses
recent
improvements
in
the
language
in
three
areas
:
complex
display
,
logical
control
,
and
subprogramming
.
In
the
area
of
complex
display
,
the
most
prominent
improvements
are
a
notation
for
integration
and
for
the
binomial
coefficients
.
In
the
area
of
logical
control
the
chief
new
feature
is
a
notation
for
variably
nested
looping
.
The
discussion
of
subprogramming
is
focused
on
MADCAP
's
notation
for
and
use
of
"
procedures

given
to
the

Timing

the

Approximately
260,000

of
systems

library
.
Problem

are
discussed
for
transmitting

with
minimum
delaying
and
interruption
of
the
arithmetic

Dumps
on

considered
for
both
recovery
from

Some

A
very
high
percentage

have
apparently
entered

it
has
proven

for
most
and
they
expect
to
remain
in
the
field
during
the
next
five
years
.
Their
principal
job
satisfactions
relate
to
the
nature
of
their
work
,
and
mostfind
their
jobs

of
professional
interest
and

A
formula

numerical

prepared
,
which
involves
an
exponential
term
.
This
formula
is
compared
to
two
standard
integration
methods
,
and
it
is
shown
that
for
a
large
class
of
differential
equations
,
the
exponential
formula
has
superior
stability
properties
for
large
step
sizes
.
Thus
this
formula
may
be
used
with
a
large
step
size
to
decrease
the
total
computing
time
for
a
solution
significantly
,
particularly
in
those
engineering
problems
where

The
serial
SABRAC
computer
designed
and
built
in
the
Scientific
Department
of
the
Israel
defense
Ministry
has
a
5000
-
location
magnetic
drum
,
main
store
.
To
avoid
a
need
to
resort
to
optimum
programming
techniques
and
to
increase
its
overall
efficiency
the
computer
has
also
been
given
a
224
-
word
ferrite
core
store
from
which
the
program
is
obeyed
.
Transfers
between
the
core
and
drum
stores
and
to
and
from
the
twin
paper
-
tape
input
and
output
channels
are
all
available
autonomously
(
concurrently
,
time
-
shared
)
.
Multiplication
and
division
orders
are
also
autonomous
,
so
that
the
machine
may
be
executing
up
to
three
orders
simultaneously
.
All
functions
naturally
are
interlocked
.
A
number
of
other
advanced
orders
and
facilities
are
also
incorporated
.
In
particular
,
an
"
Execute
"
order
permits
a
temporary
jump
for
up
to
four
orders
and
a
second
modifier
register
permits
double
modification
in
general
and
relative
addressing
of
subroutines
in
particular
.
Thus
the
overall
effective
speed
of
the
machine
is
muchhigher
than
its
basic
specification
would
lead
one
to
expect
and
its
design
indicates
one
way
in
which
the
concepts
of
time
sharing
may
be
incorporated

Use

Tree

Tree+Structures
Processing+Files
.W
In
data
processing
problems
,
files
are
frequently
used
which
must
both
be
searched
and
altered
.
Binary
search
techniques
are
efficient
for
searching
large
files
,
but
the
associated
file
organization
is
not
readily
adapted
to
the
file
alterations
.
Conversely
,
a
chained
file
allocation
permits
efficient
alteration
but
cannot
be
searched
efficiently
.
A
file
organized
into
a
tree
-
like
structure
is
discussed
,
and
it
is
shown
that
such
a
file
may
both
be
searched
and
altered
with
times
proportional
to
slog
(
s
)
N
,
where
N
is
the
number
of
file
items
and
s
is
a
parameter
of
the
tree
.
It
is
also
shown
that
optimizing
the
value
of
s
leads
to
a
search
time
which
is
only
25
per
cent
slower
than
the
binary
search
.
The
tree
organization
employs
two
data
chains
and
may
be
considered
to
be
a
compromise
between
the
organizations
for
the
binary
search
and
the
chained
file
.
The
relation
of
the
tree
organization
to
multidimensional
indexing
and
to
the
trie
structure
is
also
discussed
.

.W
The
substantial
differences
in
characteristics
of
random
access
storage
and
tape
devices
dictate
that
concepts
and
objectives
of
computer
program
design
be
considered
from
the
viewpoint
of
the
external
file
medium
used
.
This
is
particularly
true
in
the
case
of
sorting
.
In
a
tape
-
oriented
system
,
the
major
sorting
problem
is
that
of
minimizing
merge
time
despite
the
limited
orders
of
merge
possible
.
In
contrast
,
sorting
in
a
random
access
-
oriented
system
encourages
the
selection
of
the
optimum
order
of
merge
from
many
possible
orders
.
The
latter
problem
is
discussed
in
this
paper
,
along
with
criteria
developed
for
determining
the
optimum
order
of
merge
according
to
the
various
properties
of
random
access
storage
devices
.
Attention
is
also
given
to
the
problem
of
key
sorting
versus
record
sorting
and
the
possibly
serious
disadvantage
of
key
sorting
on
a
random
access
system
.

The

the

stage
of

program
(
the
formation
of

as
well
as
for
sorting
records
within
a
memory

(
an
internal

)

It
is
shown
that
given
N
records
in

,
records
are
sequenced
using

N
tests
per

,
that
initial

that

can
be

.W
Dynamic
programming
has
recently
been
used
by
Stone
,
by
Bellman
and
by
Gluss
to
determine
the
closet
fit
of
broken
line
segments
to
a
curve
in
an
interval
under
the
constraint
that
the
number
of
segments
is
fixed
.
In
the
present
paper
successive
models
are
developed
to
extend
the
method
to
the
fitting
of
broken
plane
segments
to
surfaces
z
=
g
(
x
,
y
)
defined
over
certain
types
of
subareas
of
the
(
x
,
y
)
-
space
.
The
first
model
considers
a
rectangular
area
,
with
the
constraint
that
the
plane
segments
are
defined
over
a
grid
in
the
(
x
,
y
)
-
space
.
It
is
then
shown
how
this
model
may
be
incorporated
into
an
algorithm
that
provides
successive
approximations
to
optimal
fits
for
any
type
of
closed
area
.
Finally
,
applications
are
briefly
described

study
that
constituted
a
fairly
typical
piece
of
applied
statistical
research
,
involving
extensive
computations
on
a

large

of
data
.
Wehave
found
that
the
many
different
numerical
processes
that
were
required
could
be
built
up
almost
completely
from
a
small
number
of
basic
operations
,
and
a
set
of
FORTRAN
subroutines
has
been
written
to
perform
these
.
The
main
purpose
of
this
note
is
to
describe
these
subroutines
,
but
since
the
question
of
general
statistical
programs
is
topical
[

,
we
include
some
general
remarks

computations
of
highly

computers
as
can

expected
to

much

will
have
to
be
recast

By
this
is
meant
that

which
consist
of
several

which
can
be
computed
without

of
the
results
of
the
other

As
an
example
,
a
method
is
proposed
for
"

the

of
an

,

completed
a

of

the

the
1604
,
however

the

The

concerns
the

The
473L
command
and
control
system
used
by
the
Air
Force
permits
many
operators
to
access
large
data
files
through
the
use
of
a
computer
.
The
man
-
machine
interface
is
satisfied
by
several
communication
consoles
from
which
operators
may
enter
queries
and
view
replies
.
A
data
link
permits
remote
stations
to
send
messages
,
status
reports
and
inventories
directly
to
the
computer
.
The
information
received
over
the
on

line
data
link
is
used
to
update
the
data
files
which
are
stored
on
disk
.
The
473L
programming
system
is
divided
into
an
Executive
Control
Program
and
five
components
with
different
processing
priorities
.
These
priorities
permit
the
system
to
be
most
sensitive
to
the
console
inputs
and
permit
the
operators
at
all
the
consoles
to
time
share
the
central

.
The
Executive

Program
provides
for
the
orderly

of

among
the

.
The
major
emphasis
of

on
the

In
the
thermal
detection
of
rapid
biochemical
reactions
it
is
necessary
to
correct
the
temperature
data
for
transient
heat
conduction
losses
in
a
cylindrical
calorimeter
.
To
handle
the
complexities
arising
from
varying
thermal
-
relaxation
times
of
concentric
insulating
layers
,
a
computer
program
was
developed
which
gives
the
temperature
distribution
of
the
system
as
a
function
of
radius
and
time
.
This
distribution
is
corrected
at
each
step
by
a
subroutine
which
calculates
the
instantaneous
chemical
state
of
there
action
,
as
well
as
the
heat
produced
by
this
reaction
.
The
program
is
based
on
a
direct
statement
of
Fourier
's
law
of
heat
conduction
and
the
chemical
rate
equation
to
provide
a
"
bookkeeping
law
"
to
follow
the
reactants
and
the
flow
of
heat
packets
,
in
such
a
way
that
the
computer
continually
stores
the
heat
distribution
.
A
computer
analysis
method
is
here
regarded
as
one
in
which
the
physical
laws
of
a
process
are
used
explicitly
in
the
program
.
Usually
this
results
in
by
passing
much
of
the
mathematical
procedures
conventionally
used
.
The
program
was
tested
against
some
known
exact
solutions
of
the
heat
equation
and
gave
identical
results
,
and
compared
well
with
experimental
data
of
a
known
biochemical
reaction
.
The
construction
of
computer
programs
based
on
the
direct
statement
of
the
physical
laws
is
a
principle
of
general
applicability
which
has
been
applied
to
several

phenomena

a

of

in

called
syntactic
sentence

.
Every
program
for

determines
a

A+Method

.W
A
syntax
checker
was
designed
based
on
the
syntax
of
ALGOL
as
described
in
the
ALGOL
60
Report
[
Communications
of
the
ACM
,
May
,
1960
]
.
Since
the
definition
of
the
elements
of
the
language
is
recursive
it
seemed
most
desirable
to
design
the
syntax
checker
as
a
set
of
mutually
recursive
processors
tied
together
by
subroutines
which
perform
certain
bookkeeping
functions
.
Because
of
the
recursive
nature
of
the
language
and
of
the
syntax
checker
the
problem
of
recovery
after
an
error
required
much
attention
.
A
method
was
devised
which
permits
most
programs
to
be
checked
completely
despite
errors

presented

The
technique
permits
computation
of
numerical
values
of
derivatives
without
developing
analytical
expressions

.
The
key
to
the
method

the
decomposition
of
the
given
function
,
by
introduction
of
intermediate
variables
,
into
a
series
of
elementary

steps

.
The
final
step
in
this

produces

Information

:
(
a

identification
of

tagging
it
for
effective
retrieval
,
(
b
)
searching

,
how
to

to
circumvent
the

,
and
(
c
)
file
organization
to
make
access
to
information
efficient
.
For
identification
of
information
the
paper
suggests
that
a
metalanguage
(
recently
discussed
in
a
paper
by
Goffman
,
Verhoeff
and
Belzer
)
associated
with
an
object
language
be
used
.
For
searching
strategy
,
a
linear
model
for
an
evaluation
function
of
relevancy
is
developed
which
rewards
the
system
for
retrieving
relevant
documents
and
not
retrieving
the
nonrelevant
,
and
penalizes
the
system
for
the
escaped
relevant
documents
and
false
drops
.
The
inadequacies
of
a
linear
model
are
indicated
.
Two
approaches
to
file
organization
are
discussed
.
One
is
self
-
organization
of
the
file
based
on
its
history
and
past
performance
,
and
the
second
is
a
self
-

of
the

An

technique
is
described

The
technique
is
designed
to
alleviate
some
of
the
principal
problems
that
beset
current
analysis
-
large
data
workloads
,
long
span
of
time
between
project
inception
and
system
operational
date
,
the
lack
of
explicit
directions
for
conducting
data
system
analysis
and
using
the
results
,
and
the
lack
of
a
technique
to
control
data
system
changes
throughout
its
lifetime
.
The
analysis
is
geared
to
determining
workload
,
relationships
and
storage
characteristics
of
documents
in
the
information
network
automatically

(

single

.
This
report
describes
the
use
of
two

more
consecutive

as
one

.
Such
use
results
in
a
considerable
saving
in
both

space
required
to
hold
a
given
amount
of
data
,
and
in
the
execution

to
perform
a

process
on
the
data
.
Following
a
brief
description
of
standard

the
multiword

are
introduced
.
Then

Finally
,
several

Use
of
linear
programming
models
has
grown
so
extensively
in
recent
years
that
the
whole
concept
for
organizing
a
computer
code
has
undergone
a
radical
change
.

adequate
merely
to
reduce
a
mathematical
algorithm

i

e
.
the

)
to
a
computer
code
.
An
advanced
code
must
cope
with
such
a
variety
of
situations
that
the
respective
computer
subprograms
must
be
organized
into
an
integrated
system
.
Emphasis
in
this
paper
is
devoted
to
the
underlying
principles
upon
which
future
linear
programming
systems
must
be
based
.
These
viewpoints
are
influenced
by
the
new
demands
that
applications
within
the
petroleum
industry
are
placing
on
such
systems

Some
of

components

Professional

Professional+Computer
Computer+Work
.W
Developments
in
computer
technology
have
opened
new
professional
opportunities
for
the
intelligent
blind
.
Since
there
are
few
if
any
occupations
in
which
the
blind
can
participate
without
serious
disadvantage
,
the
opportunities
offered
them
to
gain
entrance
into
various
occupations
through
computer
use
including
that
of
programmer
,
is
important
for
future
rehabilitation
planning
.
Also
of
immediate
interest
is
the
fact
that
the
blind
may
be
especially
suited
for
programming
work
.
Because
of
intense
training
in
and
constant
experience
with
locating
objects
in
the
unseen
environment
and
also
because
of
superbly
trained
memory
,
the
blind
brings
to
the
work
of
programming
skills
which
the
sighted
has
had
little
need
to
acquire
.
These
qualifications
should
result
in
fewer
debugging
problems
and
make
the
blind
a
valuable
addition
to
any
systems
group
.
Before
the
blind
could
become
a
serious
professional
,
a
number
of
aids
and
techniques
had
to
be
developed
that
can
mediate
between
machines
and

.

.W
The
problem
of
compiling
efficient
6600
codes
prompted
the
development
of
an
intermediate
language
reflecting
the
structure
of
the
machine
,
that
is
more
easily
manipulated
in
improving
object
program
efficiency
.
The
subject
of
this
paper
is
the
intermediate
language
and
methods
of
manipulating
it
.
Compilations
of
a
series
of
arithmetic
statements
are
discussed
.
It
is
assumed
that
all
functions
and
exponentials
have
been
removed
from
these
statements
,
and
replaced
by
simple
variables
.
For
purposes
of
simplicity
the
treatment
of
subscripts
is
ignored
.
A
simplified
6600
structure
is
presented
to
illustrate
the
compiling
method
.
Several
assumptions
are
made
for
purposes
of
simplification
,
although
there
are
cases
in
which
the
assumptions
are
violated
in
the
actual
machine

.W
The
structure
of
a
digital
compute
programming
language
which
covers
a
wide
class
of
business
and
file
processing
applications
is
presented
.
Such
a
structure
,
based
on
identifying
and
incorporating
into
a
compiler
the
aspects
common
to
all
processes
of
such
class
,
permits
writing
extremely
compact
programs
,
even
for
comparatively
complex
applications
,
in
terms
of
tables
of
control
expressions
which
express
only
information
characteristic
of
the
particular
application
.
Furthermore
,
local
changes
of
a
process
(
e
.
g
.
changes
affecting
only
one
of
the
output
files
involved
)
can
be
effected
by
local
modifications
in
the
program
(
e
.
g
.
modification
of
only
one
entry
of
the
tables
)
.
This
structure
also
allows
for
inexpensive
preparation
of
loading
-
speed
compilers
which
translate
the
source
programs
into
efficient
machine
codes
.
The
approach
adopted
here
departs
from
conventional
mechanical
language
design
philosophies
.
It
stresses
the
structural
analysis
of
the
class
of
processes
to
be
represented
in
the
languages
,
as
opposed
to
emphasizing
formal
(
i
.
e
.
,
contents
-
independent
)
syntactical
definitions
.
It
relies
exclusively
on
nonprocedural
representation
of
process
as
sets
(
tables
)
of
relations
between
data
and
results
(
there
are
no
control
statements
such
as
GO
TO
,
etc
.
)
,
instead
of
using
procedure
descriptions
(
which
are
one
-
to
-
one
translations
of
flowcharts
)
.
Here
an
invariant
pattern
of
procedure
is
identified
as
characteristic
of
the
class
of
all
batch
file
processes
.
This
new
philosophy
has
the
potential
to
overcome
well
-
known
deficiencies
of
other
business
-
oriented
languages
and
fully
meets
the
requirements
set
by
CODASYL
for
such

machine

A
comparative
study
has
been
made
of
a
variety
of
numerical
techniques
for
fitting
experimental
data
of
the
decay
type
by
forms
involving
the
sums
of
exponentials
.
Statistical
errors
of
the
fitted
parameters
are
also
calculated
.
These
methods
have
been
applied
to
artificially
-
generated
sets
of
data
as
well
as
to
the
results
of
experiments
with
radioactive
tracers
on
both
human
and
animal
subjects
.
Results
show
that
the
values
of
the
fitted
parameters
are
very
sensitive
to
variations
in
the
fitting
procedure
.
Therefore
great
care
very
sensitive
to
variations
in
the
fitting
procedure
.
Therefore
great
care
must
be
exercised
in
identifying
such
values
with
physical
constants
.
Although
the
values
of
functions
derived
from
these
fitted
parameters
which
can
definitely
be
associated
with
physical
entities
are
generally
more
stable
under
variations
in
the
fitting
techniques
,
error
bounds
can
be
so
large
that
no
great
confidence
can
be
placed
even
in
them
.
It
would
therefore
appear
best
to
select
a
uniform
technique
both
for
running
the
experiments
and
for
analyzing
the
data
,
and
then
to
consider
as
significant
only
relative

.W
A
partially

algorithm
is
presented
for
solving
the
following
problem
arising
from
automatic
layout
of
a
computer
.
Given
an
ordered
set
E1
,
E2
,
...
,
EN
of
N
computer
components
,
for
each
permutation
of
the
elements
E1
,
E2
..
,
EN
,
there
is
attached
a
value
of
an
integer
function
F
.
The
algorithm
finds
a
local
minimum
of
F
by
evaluating
the
set
{
Delta
F
}
of
the
increments
corresponding
to
a
certain
set
of
exchanges
of
two
elements
.
Then
the
exchange
corresponding
to
the
least
negative
increment
of
{
Delta
F
}
is
performed
.
The
process
is
iterated
and
stopped
when
the
set
of
the
increments
is
a
positive
or
empty
set
,
which
,
it
is
proved
,
corresponds
to
a
minimum
.
The
procedure
is
similar
to
the
Downhill
Method
for
finding
the
minimum
of
a
real
function
F
(

)
,
and
can

Analyzing

.W
A
dependency
analysis
system
based
on
pattern
recognition
and
learning
logic
was
developed
to
infer
word
classes
and
rules
of
syntactic
combination
from
experience
with
text
which
had
been
analyzed
.
The
characteristics
used
to
form
word
classes
are
the
depth
in
the
dependency
tree
of
each
word
,
the
direction
of
its
governor
and
the
same
features
for
each
of
its
immediate
neighbors
.
Syntactic
rules
of
combination
show
the
relation
of
a
word
to
its
governor
in
the
depth
pattern
of
the
sentence
.
The
system
was
tested
on
400
elementary
basic
English
sentences
including
300
used
earlier
by
Knowlton
in
a
different
learning
parser
of
all
400
sentences
.
After
experience
with
300
sentences
it
was
able
to
generalize
with
77
percent
accuracy
to
the
next
100
.
In
accumulative
learning
trials
after
the
first
200
sentences
it
averaged
a
probability
of
.
9
for
accurately
parsing
each
new
sentence
it
encountered
.
It
was
concluded
that
the
system
is
adequate
for
learning
to
parse
the
bulk
of
basic
English
but
that
further
development
is
required
before
conclusions
about
its
application
to
ordinary
English
can
be
stored
.

system
is
operational
and

ACM
Repository
at

,
University

,
is
reviewed
briefly
.
Two
principles
are
presented
as
paramount
in
the
provision
of
information
services
:
(
1
)
easy
accessibility
to
the
information
files
by
users
unfamiliar
with
file
organization
,
and
(
2
)
value
of
service
exceeding
user
costs
.
These
principles
serve
as
guides
in
mechanizing
the
ACM
Repository
.
The
main
features
of
the
information
system
are
direct
user
access
via
on
-
line
teletypewriter
console
,
direct
user
access
to
all
details
of
the
system
organization
,
unrestricted
and
expandable
search
vocabulary
,
user
access
through
many
facets
of
document
indexing
,
and
stochastic
search
through
linked
index
terms
and
other
file
relationships
.
The
first
contribution
to
the
ACM
Repository
consisted
of
315
documents
,
relating
primarily
to
early
research
on
compilers
.
These
documents
have
been
cataloged
and
indexed
and
the
catalog
is
scheduled
to
appear
in
Computing
Reviews
.
The
indexing
system
is
described
in
detail
.
The
Main

is
used
to
describe
the

,
and
inverted

are

scan
an

produced

The

A

is
an
integral
part
of
a
data
processing
system
.
In
many
systems
,
the
selection
of
an
organization
for
the
data
within
the
file
can
be
critical
to
the
system
's
operating
efficiency
.
This

provides
the
systems
designer
with
an
information
source
which
describes
ten
techniques
that
may
be
employed
for
organizing
structured
data
.
The
characteristics
of
the
organizations
described
are
application

,
thus
providing
the
designer
with
a
reference
which
allows
him
to
limit

organizations
he
must

is
described
which

assign

its
form
class
or

The
program
operates
at
relatively
high
speed
in
only
a
limited

About
half
of
the

in
a
corpus
are
identified
through
the
use
of
a
small
dictionary
of
function
words

Some

logical

employed

code
additional

Finally

one

A
fully

system
operating
on
the
IBM

described
.
The
system
is
characterized
by
the
fact
that
several
hundred
different
methods
are
available
to
analyze
documents
and
search
requests
.
This
feature
is
used
in
the
retrieval
process

leaving
the
exact
sequence
of
operations
initially
unspecified
,
and
adapting
the
search
strategy
to
the
needs
of
individual
users
.
The
system
is
used
not
only
to
simulate
an
actual
operating
environment
,
but
also
to
test
the
effectiveness
of
the
various
available
processing
methods
.
Results
obtained
so
far
seem
to
indicate
that
some
combination
of
analysis
procedures
can
in
general
be
relied
upon
to
retrieve
the
wanted
information

A

In

theory
,
arithmetic
must
be
carried
out
to
a
degree
of
precision
which
exceeds
the
normal
hardware
capacity
of
most
machines
.
In
such
cases
,
an
extended

package
provides
a
comprehensive
and
easy
-
to
-
use
way
of
performing
such
arithmetic
.
Such
a

Unlike

an

This
results
in
a
correction

A

technique
is
presented
for
PERT
Time
calculations
without
topological
ordering
.
Each
event
is
assigned
a
unique
memory
location
.
An
activity
is
represented
by
a
link
.
A
link
is
defined
as
a
memory
location
containing
the
address
of
another
memory
location
.
The
time
information
for
an
activity
is
carried
with
its
link
.
For
a
typical
net
,
the
majority
of
activities
can
be
described
by
one
36
-
bit
cell
each
.
The
remainder
use
two
36

The

are
unidirectional

This
paper
describes
a
technique
designed
to
ease
the
use
of
a
data
processing
system
by
a
person
,
in
particular
,
a
scientist
,
who
is
intimately
and
primarily
concerned
with
interpreting
the
significance
of
data
handled
by
the
system
.
Since
such
a
person
is
often
unable
to
spend
the
time
necessary
to
master
a
programming
language
,
it
is
essential
that
he
be
aided
in
composing
commands
to
the
computer
.
In
the
system
described
,
the
user
is
not
required
to
learn
or
remember
the
vocabulary
of
the
language
because
the
vocabulary
is
displayed
before
him
on
"
menus
"
by
means
of
a
computer
-
drive
scope
.
He
selects
the
various
vocabulary
elements
required
by
pointing
with
the
light
pen
.
By
use
of
a
small
unordered
set
of
rewriting
rules
applied
as
a
result
of
light
pen
selections
,
the
user
generates
only
syntactically
correct
commands
to
the
system
.
He
does
not
have
to
learn
or
remember
the
grammar
.
The
program
restricts
the
user
severely
in
the
particular
language
he
can
use
,
but
the
method
for
communicating
with
the
program
makes
these
restrictions
seem
quite
natural
and
unconstraining
.
The
program
has
been
used
successfully
for
over

the

This
paper
describes
how
some
of
the
semantics
of
ALGOL

can
be
formalized
by
establishing
a
correspondence
between
expressions
of
ALGOL

in

form
of

notation
.
First
a
model
for
computer
languages
and
compute
behavior
is
described
,
based
on
the
notions
of
functional
application
and
functional
abstraction
,
but
also
having
analogues
for
imperative
language
features
.
Then
this
model
is
used
as
an
"
abstract
object
language
"
into
which
ALGOL
60
is
mapped
.
Many
of
ALGOL
60
's
features
emerge
as
particular
arrangements
of
a
small
number
of
structural
rules
,
suggesting
new
classifications
and
generalizations
.
The

The

,
may
converge

not
when
the
approximating

are
rational

However
,
the
few

known
in

show
how
efficient
the
algorithm
can
be
to
obtain
approximations
with
a
small
error
,
much
more
than
in
the
polynomial
case
,
in
which
the

can
be
very
nearly
approached
directly
by
a

The

of
this

is
to
investigate
the
limitations
of
the
applicability
of
certain
extensions
of
the
algorithm
to
the
case
where
the

are

that
for

G
,
a

where
Z
and

of

Data
string

discussed

a

of
control
characters
associated
with
the
principle
of
code

that
is
,
with
the
representation
of
information
which
cannot
be
directly
represented

means
of

characters
in

.
The
manner
of
use
of
these
characters
has
not

This

presents
a
set
of
mutually

philosophies
regarding
code

applications
,
and
suggests
a
corollary
set
of
doctrines
for
the
application
of
the
code

characters
.
Distinctions
are
drawn
between
code
extension
and
such
other
concepts
as
"

"
or
"

"
which
are

.W
The
FORMAC
(
FORmula
MAnipulation
Compiler
)
programming
system
provides
a
powerful
tool
for
performing
mathematical
analysis
.
It
is
an
extension
of
FORTRAN
IV
which
permits
the
use
of
the
computer
to
perform
the
tedious
algebraic
computations
that
arise
in
many
different
fields
.
Among
the
areas
in
which
it
has
been
successfully
used
are
:
differentiation
of
complicated
expressions
,
expansion
of
truncated
power
series
,
solution
of
simultaneous
equations
with
literal
coefficients
,
nonlinear
maximum
likelihood
estimation
,
tensor
analysis
,
and
generation
of
the
coefficients
of
equations
in
Keplerian
motion
.
These
types
of
analysis
-
which
arose
in
the
solution
of
specific
practical
problems
in
physics
,
engineering
,
astronomy
,
statistics
and
astronautics
-
are
discussed
in
the
paper
.
In
addition
to
its
usage
for
specific
problem
solutions
,
FORMAC
can
also
be
used
to
automate
the
analysis
phase
in
certain
production
programming
.
Several
such

are
presented

Discussion
of
the
Technique
and
Comparison
of
Languages
Computer+Simulation
.W
The
purpose
of
this
paper
is
to
present
a
comparison
of
some
computer
simulation
languages
and
of
some
of
the
involved
in
comparing
software
packages
for
digital
computers
are
discussed
in
Part
I
.
The
issue
is
obvious
:
users
of
digital
computers
must
choose
from
available
languages
or
write
their
own
.
Substantial
costs
can
occur
,
particularly
in
training
,
implementation
and
computer
time
if
an
inappropriate
language
is
chosen
.
More
and
more
computer
simulation
languages
are
being
developed
:
comparisons
and
evaluations
of
existing
languages
are
useful
for
designers
and
implementers
as
well
as
users
.
The
second
part
is
devoted
to
computer
simulation
and
simulation
languages
.
The
computational
characteristics
of
simulation
are
discussed
with
special
attention
being
paid
to
a
distinction
between
continuous
and
discrete
change
models
.
Part
III
presents
a
detailed
comparison
of
six
simulation
languages
and
packages
:
SIMSCRIPT
,
CLP
,
CSL
,
GASP
,
CPSS
and
SOL
.
The
characteristics
of
each
are
summarized
in
a
series
of
tables
.
The
implications
of
this
analysis
for
designers
of
languages
,
for
users
,
and
for
implementers
are
developed
.
The
conclusion
of
the
paper
is
that
the
packages
now
available
for
computer
simulation
offer
features
which
none
of
the
more
general
-
purpose
packages
do
and
that
analysis
of
strengths
and
weaknesses
of
each
suggests
ways
in
which
both
current
and
future
simulation
languages
and
packages
can
be
improved
.

Final

of

A+Final

Dangling+Else
Related+Languages
.W
The
dangling
else
problem
consists
of
a
class
of
potential
ambiguities
in
ALGOL
-
like
conditional
statements
whose
basic
form
is
"
if
B1
then
if
B2
then
S1
else
S2
"
where
B1
and
B2
are
Boolean
expressions
and
S1
and
S2
are
basic
statements
.
The
difficulty
lies
in
whether
to
attach
the
else
to
the
first
if
or
to
the
second
one
.
Existing
solutions
to
the
problem
are
either
ambiguous
or
unnecessarily
restrictive
.
Let
Sand
S1
be
statements
.
We
define
S
to
be
closed
if
"
S
else
S1
"
is
not
a
statement
,
and
to
be
open
if
"
S
else
S1
"
is
a
statement
.
Thus
an
unconditional
statement
is
a
closed
statement
.
Open
and
closed
conditional
statements
are
defined
by
syntax
equations
in
such
a
way
as
to
preserve
openness
and
closure
.
In
each
case
,
an
else
must
always
be
preceded
by
a
closed
statement
.
It
is
shown
that
the
syntax
equations
are
unambiguous
,
and
that
may
change
in
the
statement
types
required
within
the
syntax
equations
would
lead
to
either
ambiguity
or
unnecessary
restriction

The
use
of
computers
to
permit
the
widespread
application
of
mathematical
ideas
requiring
computation
in
science
and
technology
is
extremely
significant
for
the
understanding
of
our
current
society
.
Student
interest
in
this
development
is
intense
and
if
properly
utilized
should
yield
a
much
better
understanding
of
mathematical
concepts
as
well
as
the
ideas
of
programming
and
logical
structure
which
have
been
introduced
into
many
fields
by
the
use
of
computers
.
The
present
paper
suggests
that
that
portion
of
the
undergraduate
mathematical
curriculum
which
is
preparation
for
the
use
of
mathematics
by
persons
who
are
not
professional
mathematicians
be
modified
to
include
the
extensions
and
clarifications
which
are
possible
because
of
computers
.
An
early
introduction
to
programming
is
desirable
to
permit
a
continuing
use
of
automatic
computation
to
illustrate
and
clarify
mathematical
concepts
.
Following
the
calculus
equation
stage
an
intensive
introduction
to
numerical
analysis
should
be
added
to
the
current
curriculum
.
In
addition
to
providing
competence
in
the
mostly
used
computing
techniques
,
it
would
permit
a
more
sophisticated
utilization
of
the
advanced

The

procedure
as
described
by
Williams
has
been
coded
in
LISP

FORMAC
and
used
in
solving
systems
of
polynomial
equations

It

found

the
method
is
very
effective
in
the
case
of
small
systems

where
it
yields
all
solutions
without

need
for

The
method
,
by
itself

appears
in
appropriate
,
however

in
the
solution
of
large
systems
of
equation
due
to
the
explosive
growth
in

A

and
then
generates
the

for

The

are

symbolically
,
hence
any
non

parameters
in
the
original
equations
are
carried
automatically
into
the

Thus
the

A
programming
language
is
described
which
is
applicable
to
problems
conveniently
described
by
transformation
rules
.
By
this
is
meant
that
patterns
may
be
prescribed
,
each
being
associated
with
a
skeleton
,
so
that
a
series
of
such
pairs
may
be
searched
until
a
pattern
is
found
which
matches
an
expression
to
be
transformed
.
The
conditions
for
a
match
are
governed
by
a
code
which
also
allows
subexpressions
to
be
identified
and
eventually
substituted
into
the
corresponding
skeleton
.
The
primitive
patterns
and
primitive
skeletons
are
described
,
as
well
as
the
principle
which
allow
their
elaboration
in
to
more
complicated
patterns
and
skeletons
.
The
advantages
of
the
language
are
that
it
allows
one
to
apply
transformation
rules
to
lists
and
arrays
as
easily
as
strings
,
that
both
patterns
and
skeletons
may
be
defined
recursively
,
and
that
as
a
consequence
programs
may
be
stated
quite
concisely
.

The
Eschenbach

Scheme
The+Eschenbach
Eschenbach+Drum
Drum+Scheme
.W
The
prime
function
of
a
drum
,
operating
in
real
time
,
is
to
perform
accesses
quickly
.
The
usual
means
for
increasing
this
capacity
is
to
incorporate
engineering
or
hardware
improvements
.
In
this
paper
the
problem
is
attacked
not
by
changing
the
drum
,
but
rather
by
modifying
the
manner
in
which
it
operates
.
At
the
outset
,
a
drum
is
given
a
functional
definition
.
Then
a
simple
design
scheme
(
Eschenbach
)
is
introduced
which
enormously
increases
the
rate
of
accessing
for
drums
so
defined
.
This
is
shown
to
enable
a
system
to
perform
a
job
by
employing
fewer
or
less
expensive
drums
.
It
is
suggested
that
although
the
design
scheme
has
a

The
question
of
the

of
the

then
raised
.
To
deal
with
this
,
a
standard
of
efficiency

The

modelled

Thus
one
is

to
ascertain
whether

allows
a
simple

which
results
in
an

and
provides
possibilities
for
an

has
a
command

similar
to
large

,
and
uses

The

For

the

included

Large

noted
for

The
most

was

To

Most
large
commercial

have
progressed
to
the
point
where
their
major
accounting
applications
have
been
automated
and
more
sophisticated
usage
of
data
processing
equipment
is
being
sought
.
This
,
coupled
with
the
availability
of
equipment
well
suited
to
real

,
direct

,
has
led
to
development
within
some
banks
of
the
central
file
of
data
base
approach
toward
a
banking
information
system
.
The
banking
information
system
now
serves
the
two

purpose
of
providing
real

responses
to
inquires
about
individual

and
providing
more

use
.
Both
kinds
of
processing
draw
upon
a
common

of
data
contained
in
the
direct

central
file
.
This
data
base
includes
indexes
which
facilitate
cross
referencing
of
account

so
that
all
relationships
between
bank
and

may
be
discerned
.
In
introducing
the
banking

concept
,
a
gradual
approach
to
account
cross

is
most
prudent

Automatic
Derivation

Microsentences
Automatic+Derivation
.W
The
decomposition
of
long
complex
English
sentences
into
shorter
kernel
-
like
constituent
sentences
(
microsentences
)
has
often
been
suggested
as
an
avenue
toward
conducting
automatic
retrieval
of
natural
language
messages
.
To
explore
the
prospects
of
such
a
step
,
the
authors
attempted
in
1963
to
prepare
a
general
program
for
deriving
microsentences
from
longer
sentences
that
had
been
syntactically
analyzed
by
the
Harvard
Multipath
Analysis
Program
.
The
basic
idea
was
to
extract
the
subject
,
verb
and
object
(
if
any
)
of
each
clause
and
to
reassemble
these
materials
into
a
grammatical
microsentence
.
A
program
is
described
in
this
paper
,
which
was
designed
to
operate
on
the
tree
structure
output
of
the
analyzer
,
and
the
microsentences
that
were
produced
are
exhibited
.
The
authors
conclude
that
while
microsentences
of
the
quality
achieved
do
not
open
up
immediate
prospects
for
improving
the
performance
of
automatic
message
retrieval
systems
,
they
may
have
practical
value
in

A
Simple

the
Generalized
Inverse
of

Matrix
A+Simple
Simple+Algorithm
Generalized+Inverse
.W
The
generalized
inverse
of
a
matrix
is
important
in
analysis
because
it
provides
an
extension
of
the
concept
of
an
inverse
which
applies
to
all
matrices
.
It
also
has
many
applications
in
numerical
analysis
,
but
it
is
not
widely
used
because
the
existing
algorithms
are
fairly
complicated
and
require
considerable
storage
space
.
A
simple
extension
has
been
found
to
the
conventional
orthogonalization
method
for
inverting
non
-
singular
matrices
,
which
gives
the
generalized
inverse
with
little
extra
effort
and
with
no
additional
storage
requirements
.
The
algorithm
gives
the
generalized
inverse
for
any
m
by
n
matrix
A
,
including
the
special
case
when
m
+
n
and
A
is
non
-
singular
and
the
case
when
m
>
n
and
rank
(
A
)
=
n
.
In
the
first
case
the
algorithm
gives
the
ordinary
inverse
of
A
.
In
the
second
case
the
algorithm
yields
the
ordinary
least
squares
transformation
matrix
INV
(
A

and
has
the
advantage
of
avoiding
the
loss

results
in

the

As

models
grow
bigger
and
bigger
in
size
,
much
actual
data
that
must
be
memorized
is
often
put
on
magnetic
tape

,
and
consequently
there
is
an
improportionality
fast
rise
in
the

To
cut
down
this
expense
,
an
ever

is
made
to
design
more

This

is
meant
to
support
the
effort
.
It

attempted
to
find
some

way

The
number
of
repetitions
of
a
certain
transfer
of

from

is
considered

After
some
simplification

the
problem
is
restated
in
a
general

The
generating

of

the

Asymptotic

The

A

carrying
out
the
elimination
algorithm
of
Gorn
,
similar
to
Gaussian
elimination
for

of
algebraic
equations
,
is
described
.
This
was
applied
to
numerous
smaller

,
including
some
sublanguage
of
ALGOL
.
A

result
of
the
application
of

For
the
nonprogrammer
,
difficulty
in
using
a
language
increases
rapidly
with
the
number
of
nonproblem
-
oriented
conventions
.
A
simple
language
,
even
if
inelegant
,
which
considers
the
user
's
background
as
part
of
the
problem
may
be
more
effective
than
a
source
language
containing
subtle
and
more
powerful
capabilities
.
The
language
described
in
this
paper
is
used
to
write
computer
programs
which
test
electronic
equipment
.
Because
this
testing
process
contains
few
complex
ideas
,
there
is
little
need
for
the
elegance
and
redundancy
of
a
highly
syntax
-
oriented
language
.
A
simple
and
direct
language
will
suffice
for
the
problem
.
The
eventual
users
of
this
language
are
military
depot
personnel
who
cannot
he
expected
to
have
computer
programming
skill
or
significant

.
For
this

,
it
was
essential
to
create
a
language
using
familiar

;
programming

unnecessarily
complicated

A
description
of
the
TRAC
(

language
and
processing
algorithm
is
given
.
The
TRAC
language
was
developed
as
the
basis
of
a
software
package
for
the
reactive
typewriter
.
In
the
TRAC
language
,
one
can
write
procedures
for
accepting
,
naming
and
storing
any
character
string
from
the
typewriter
;
for
modifying
any
string
in
any
way
;
for
treating
any
string
at
any
time
as
an
executable
procedure
,
or
as
a
name
,
or
as
text
;
and
for
printing
out
any
string
.
The
TRAC
language
is
based
upon
an
extension
and
generalization
to
character
strings
of
the
programming
concept
of
the
"
macro
.
"
Through
the
ability
of
TRAC
to
accept
and
store
definitions
of
procedures
,
the
capabilities
of
the
language
can
be
indefinitely
extended
,
and
can
deal
with
character
strings
,
integers
and
Boolean
vector
variables

An
experimental
system
that
uses
LISP
to
make
a
conceptual
dictionary
is
described
.
The
dictionary
associates
with
each
English
word
the
syntactic
information
,
definitional
material
,
and
references
to
the
contexts
in
which
it
has
been
used
to
define
other
words
.
Such
relations
as
class
inclusion
,
possession
,
and
active
or
passive
actions
are
used
as
definitional
material
.
The
resulting
structure
serves
as
a
powerful

on
the
logic
of
question

.
Examples
of
methods
of
inputting
information
and
answering

are
given

An
important
conclusion
is
that
,
although
LISP
and
other
list

languages
are
ideally
suited
for
producing
complex
associative
structures
,
they
are
inadequate

The
Structure
of
Programming
Languages
The+Structure
Programming+Languages
.W
The
following
are
identified
as
major
components
of
every
programming
language
:
(
1
)
the
elementary
program
statement
,
(
2
)
mechanisms
for
linking
elementary
statements
together
,
(
3
)
the
means
by
which
a
program
can
obtain
data
inputs
.
Several
alternative
forms
of
each
of
these
components
are
described
,
compared
and
evaluated
.
Many
examples
,
frequently
from
list
processing
languages
,
illustrate
the
forms
described
.
Elementary
program
statements
usually
take
the
form
of
commands
,
requirements
,
or
implicit
specifications
.
A
command
is
an
imperative
statement
that
commands
the
action
to
be
taken
.
A
requirement
describes
the
effect
to
be
achieved
without
saying
anything
about
the
actions
to
be
taken
.
An
implicit
specification
is
similar
to
a
requirement
,
but
the
programmer
must
understand
what
actions
will
be
taken
to
achieve
the
desired
effect
.
Subroutines
may
be
entered
explicitly
,
by
execute
call
,
or
by
function
composition
.
Explicitly
called
subroutines
generally
require
special
linkage
conventions
.
An
execute
subroutine
call
is
syntactically
indistinguishable
from
a
basic
instruction
of
the
programming
language
.
Function
composition
is
a
convenient
alternative
to
the
explicit
call
.
The
three
principal
ways
of
getting
inputs
for
routines
are
(
1
)
by
referring
to
the
data
itself
,
(
2
)
by
referring
to
the
data
by
a
"
name
"
,
and
(
3
)
by
referring
to
it
implicitly
by
means
of
variables
or
functions
.
Names
are
useful
entry
points
into
permanent
data
structures
,
but
can
be
error
-
causing
distractions
in
other
contexts
.
The
author
discusses
advantages
,
disadvantages
,
and
factors
influencing
the
choice
of
a
form
of
component
for
a
language
.
He
concludes
by
suggesting
the
evolution
of
programming
languages
toward
one
which
will
permit
all
the
most
convenient
ways
of
structuring
programs
,
organizing
systems
,
and
referencing
data

.W
In
any
prolonged
computation
it
is
generally
assumed
that
the
accumulated
effect
of
roundoff
errors
is
in
some
sense
statistical
.
The
purpose
of
this

is
to
give
precise
descriptions
of
certain
probabilistic
models
for
roundoff
error
,
and
then
to
describe
a
series

experiments
for
testing
the
validity
of
these
models
.
It
is
concluded
that
the
models
are
in
general
very
good
.
Discrepancies
are
both
rare
and
mild
.
The
test

can
also

used
to

with

Programming+Decision

.W
A
simple
broad
-
based
approach
for
programming
decision
tables
in
FORTRAN
or
COBOL
is
developed
and
presented
.
With
inputs
in
standard
form
,
as
defined
in
the
paper
,
the
programming
of
any
decision
table
can
be
done
with
one
or
two
FORTRAN
statements
,
or
with
two
COBOL
statements
,
if
the
COMPUTE
verb
is
available
in
the
COBOL
processor
.
It
is
shown
that
the
method
is
applicable
even
when
there
are
more
than
two
mutually
exclusive
states
of
one
,
two
or
more
table
conditions
.
It
is
further
shown
that
multi
-
state
conditions
in
decision
tables
can
often
simplify
the
programming
.
The
method
outlined
has
the
further
advantage
that
all
possible
combinations
of
conditions
are
considered
.
It
is
shown
that
the
suggested
procedure
is
easily
implemented
in
ALGOL

A
method
for
defining
programming
languages
is
developed
which
introduces
a
rigorous
relationship
between
structure
and
meaning
.
The
structure
of
a
language
is
defined
by
a
phrase
structure
syntax
,
the
meaning
in
terms
of
the
effects
which
the
execution
of
a
sequence
of
interpretation
rules
exerts
upon
a
fixed
set
of
variables
,
called
the
Environment
.
There
exists
a
one
-
to
-
one
correspondence
between
syntactic
rules
and
interpretation
rules
is
determined
by
the
sequence
of
corresponding
syntactic
reductions
which
constitute
a
parse
.
The
individual
interpretation
rules
are
explained
in
terms
of
an
elementary
an
d
obvious
algorithmic
notation
.
A
constructive
method
for
evaluating
a
text
is
provided
,
and
for
certain
decidable
classes
of
languages
their
unambiguity
is
proved
.
As
an
example
,
a
generalization
of
ALGOL
is
described
in
full
detail
to
demonstrate
that
concepts
like
block
-
structure
,
procedures
,
parameters
,
etc
.
can
be
defined
adequately
and
precisely
by
this
method

Normalization+Requirement

This
paper
presents
an
analysis
on
the
normalization
requirement
of
the
divisor
in
a
divide
-
and
-
correct
method
.
This
analysis
is
made
subject
to
the
condition
that
not
more
than
one
correction
is
required
to
obtain
the
true
quotient
character
,
from
the
trial
estimate
got
from
the
division
of
a
two
-
precision
segment
of
every
partial
remainder
by
a
suitably
rounded
single
-
precision
divisor
.
(
This
segmented
division
is
denoted
here
as
a
(
2
,
1
)
precision
basic
division
.
)
It
is
found
that
the
normalization
requirement
could
be
narrowed
down
to
a
smaller
range
of
divisors
,
provided
the
magnitude
of
the
character
next
to
the
leading
character
of
the
divisor
is
known
.
If
,
however
,
the
normalization
is
to
be
eliminated
one
has
to
choose
proper
higher
precision
segments
of
operands
for
the
basic
division
.
Also
considered
is
the
possibility
of
eliminating
the
normalization
by
an
increase
on
the
number
of
corrections
on
the
quotient
estimate
got
from
a
(
2
,
1
)
precision
basic
division
.
It
is
shown
that
such
a
scheme
is
economical
only
for
small

This
paper
addresses
itself
to
the
problem
of
analyzing
data
generated
by
computer
simulations
of
economic
systems
.
We
first
turn
to
a
hypothetical
firm
,
whose
operation
is
represented
by
single
-
channel
,
multistation
queueing
model
.
The
firm
seeks
to
maximize
total
expected
profit
for
the
coming
period
by
selecting
one
of
five
operating
plans
,
where
each
plan
incorporates
a
certain
marketing
strategy
,
an
allocation
of
productive
inputs
,
and
a
total
cost
.
The
results
of
the
simulated
activity
under
each
plan
are
subjected
to
an
F
-
test
,
two
multiple
comparison
methods
,
and
a
multiple
ranking
method
.
We
illustrate
,
compare
,
and
evaluate
these
techniques
.
The
paper
adopts
the
position
that
the
particular
technique
of
analysis
(
possibly
not
any
one
of
the
above
)
chosen
by
the
experimenter
should
be
an

The
subject
of
this

is
a
procedure
for
the
automatic
retrieval
of
certain
segments
of
stored
information
,
either
explicitly
or
implicitly
represented
,
through
questions
posed
in
natural
language
sentences
.
This
procedure
makes
use
of
a
sentence
recognition
device
for
the
class
of
grammars
which
will
correctly
decide
between
the
grammatical
and
ungrammatical
sentences
of
a
natural
language
.
It
is
possible
to
make
use
of
a
recognition
device
of
this
sort
for
the
following
reason
:
Much
data
is
fully
expressible
as
a
set
of
sentences
in
a
natural
language
,
a
set
which
can
be
exhaustively
and
exclusively
generated
by
a
grammar
.
Based
upon
the
rules
of
this
grammar
,
a
sentence
recognizer
will
evaluate
sentences
,
questions
in
the
normal
situation
.
Since
the
recognition
function
succeeds
just
in
case
the
posed
question
is
drawn
from
the
set
of
sentences
expressing
the
data
,
or
,
more
correctly
,
is
grammatical
in
terms
of
the
grammar
for
this
set
of
sentences
,
sentence
recognition
itself
is
a
procedure
for
retrieving
information
.
When
the
recognition
function
succeeds
,
its
value
represents
the
requested

A
means
is

extending

numerical
data
processing
stage
and
reducing
the
need
for
human
participation
in
the
formulation
of
certain
types
of
computer
problems
.
By
the
use
of
tensor
calculus
and
a
computer
language
designed
to
facilitate
symbolic
mathematical
computation
,
a
method
has
been
devised
whereby
a
digital
computer
can
be
used
to
do
non

numeric
work
,
that
is
,
symbolic
algebraic
manipulation
and
differentiation
.
To
illustrate
the
techniques
involved
,
a
digital

has
been
used
to
derive
the
equations
of
motion
of
a
point
mass
in
a
general
orthogonal

coordinate
system
.
Since
this
operation
involves
a
formulation
in
terms
of
first

order
differential
coefficients
,
it
provides
a
good

of
a

to
do
non

work
and
to
assist
in
the

which
normally

.
Moreover
,
this
particular

serves
to
illustrate
the
advantages

With

The
basic

for
the
conversion
of
decision

into
COBOL
code
is
contained
in
the
generator
portion
of
the
DETAB

preprocessor
.
The
generator
analyzes
a
decision
table
and
produces
simple
COBOL
conditional
statements
.
Core

is
saved
by
using
queueing
techniques
and
extensive
indexing
and
also
by
outputting
the
code
as
it
is
generated
,
a
line
at
a
time
.
The
only
optimization
attempted
is
the
elimination
of
obviously
unnecessary
tests
on
certain
conditions
in
the
decision
table
.
Since
the
preprocessor
and
this
language
associated
with
it
were
developed
for
COBOL
users
,
the
preprocessor
was
written
in
a

The
development
of
new
large
scale
time
-
sharing
systems
has
raised
a
number
of
problems
for
computation
center
management
.
Not
only
is
it
necessary
to
develop
an
appropriate
hardware
configuration
for
these
systems
,
but
appropriate
software
adjustments
must
be
made
.
Unfortunately
,
these
systems
often
do
not
respond
to
changes
in
the
manner
that
intuition
would
suggest
,
and
there
are
few
guides
to
assist
in
the
analysis
of
performance
characteristics
.
The
development
of
a
comprehensive
simulation
model
to
assist
in
the
investigation
of
these
questions
is
described
in
this
paper
.
The
resulting
model
has
a
general
purpose
design
and
can
be
used
to
study
a
variety
of
time

.
It
can
also
be
used
to
assist
in
the
design
and
development
of
new
time
-
sharing
algorithms
or
techniques
.
For
the
sake
of
efficiency
and
greater
applicability
,
the
model
was
implemented
in
a
limited
FORTRAN
subset
that
is
compatible
with
most

.
The
use
of
the

is

A

Multifunctional+Teaching
Teaching+System
.W
A
teaching
system
model
that
was
incorporated
into
an
operating
system
of
a
large
computer
is
described
.
The
model
transferred
control
to
the
operating
system
to
execute
functions
other
than
teaching
,
and
then
recovered
control
in
order
to
resume
teaching
.
The
teaching
system
(
ABAC
-
II
)
was
written
to
run
under
the
operating
system
(
IBSYS
)
for
the
IBM
7044
Graphic
System
.
Because
the
teaching
system
automatically
terminated
and
rescheduled
itself
,
a
student
studying
a
course
presented
at
a
cathode
-
ray
display
terminal
could
switch
readily
between
student
mode
and
programmer
mode
.
During
the
latter
,
the
full
resources
of
the
operating
system
(
language
processors
,
compilers
,
library
and
user
's
programs
)
were
at
his
disposal
.
He
could
for
example
,
write
,
assemble
,
debug
,
and
execute
at
the
terminal
a
program
written
in
any
language
processed
by
the
operating
system
.
A
course
could
therefore
include
text
material
interleaved
with
programming
problems
which
the
student
could
solve
without
leaving
the
terminal
.
Exercises
in
simulation
and
gaming
could
also
be
provided
.
The
implications
of
a
teaching
system
with
this
degree
of
flexibility
for
industrial
and
executive
training
as
well
as
academic
education
are
discussed
.
In

,
the
advantages
of
this
type
of

for

are
also
considered

formulas

A

they

new
approach
to

problem
of
scheduling
course
examinations
is
presented
.
In
principle
,
an
examination
schedule
which
requires
a
minimum
number
of
examination
periods
and
satisfies
the
constraint
that
no
student
be
required
to
take
two
examinations
simultaneously
can
be
found
in
two
steps
.
First
,
course
which
may
have
their
examinations
scheduled
at
the
same
period
are
grouped
together
in
all
possible
ways
.
Then
a
minimum
number
of
these
groups
,
such
that
each
course
is
included
at
least
once
,
are
selected
.
By
removing
multiple
occurrences
of
courses
and
then
scheduling
each
group
at
a
different
period
a
minimal
schedule
can
be
obtained
.
Known
algorithms
for
carrying
out
these
procedures
are
prohibitively
expensive
.
Approximations
to
the
ideal
procedure
outlined
above
are
given
which
yield
nonminimal
but
feasible
schedules
with
a
very
small
expenditure
of
time
.
Results
of
experiments
using
these
techniques
are
given

These
are
encouraging
and
indicate
that
further

would
be
worthwhile

The

to

.
New
polynomial
evaluation
methods
have

developed
in

which
require
fewer
multiplications
than
nested
multiplication
and
may
therefore
be
preferable
for
use
in
function

routines
.
Although
some
of
these

do
not

were
tried
failed

The
problem
is
straightforward
(

but
nevertheless
involved
an
elaborate
use
of
the
FORMAC
language
.
The
program
was
fairly
large

utilized
practically
every
command
.
In
particular
,
it
made
extensive

Several

were
necessary
in

to
circumvent
some
of
the
shortcomings

compiler
which
has
been
implemented
within
the

is
that
it
translates
FORTRAN

speeds

hence
large

A
computational
method
which
may
be
used
for
the
calculation
of
sums
of
squares
in
the
analysis
of
variance
of
complete
factorial
experiments
and
in
the
computation
of
main
effect
or
interaction
means
is
described
.
The
method
is
elucidated
as
unifying
since
one
method
can
be
used
for
a
variety
of
purposes
each
previously
requiring
different
methods
.
The
programming
advantages
of
such
a
method
are
obvious
.
The
following
variants
are
discussed
:
(
1
)
the
standard
analysis
of
variance
;
(
2
)
analyses
omitting
certain
levels
of
one
or
more
factors
;
(
3
)
separate
analyses
for
some
levels
of
a
factor
or
for
combinations
of
levels
of
more
than
one
factor
.
These
are
performed
simultaneously
;
(
4
)
the
calculation
of
main
effect
or
interaction
means
.
The
mean
expects
the
data
in
standard
order
and
it
leaves
the
data
in
that
order
so
that
many
analyses
of
the
same
data
can
be
performed
without
rearrangement
.
The
total
sum
of
squares
,
excluding
a
replication
sum
of
squares
,
is
partitioned
into
all
polynomial
partitions
and
their
interactions
each
with
one

even

An

.W
In
this
descriptive
article
an
input
code
is
presented
which
greatly
simplifies
data
input
to
any
linear
programming
solution
routine
,
for
subsequent
use
either
as
a
pedagogical
device
or
for
solving
rather
small
LP
problems
.
This
latter
(
limited
)
use
derives
not
at
all
from
inherent
limitations
in
the
code
itself
,
but
from
an
efficiency
evaluation
:
large
LP
problems
would
doubtless
benefit
from
an
input
system
more
suited
for
bulk
data
handling
than
the
input
code
described
.
From
a
user
's
standpoint
,
input
appears
almost
exactly
as
a
textbook
presentation
of
the
LP
problem
(
limited
only
by
a
keypunch
's
inability
to
write
subscripts
,
etc
.
)
.
The
input
interpreter
scans
column
wise
,
thus
no
fixed
format
data
preparation
is
required
.
The
user
may
also
,
under
very
general
requirements
only
,
liberally
use
editorial

throughout
the

deck
as
an
aid

A

been
specifically
designed
to
simplify
the
internal

processing
operations
within
an
online
computer
system
with
respect
to
non

applications
,
and
to
maximize
the
transfer
rate
of
the
information
channel
linking
the
system
and
the
system
user
.
The
code
has
direct
application
to
problems
in
area
such
as
information
retrieval
,
document
classification
,
computer
-

teaching
and
text

.
This
code
,
called
IPC
(

,
is
an

set
constructed
so
that
7

5
and
4

bit
subsets
can
be
easily
derived
from
the

.
The

is
organized
so
that
simple
binary
operations
can
distinguish
between
the
numeric

and
control

codes
.
The
number
of
usable

within
the

may
be
expanded
either
by
use
of

included
in
the

or
by

of
otherwise

on
the

An

An+Algorithm
Mathematical+Physics

.W
A
method
is
described
whereby
a
digital
computer
can
be
used
to
derive
the
equations
of
mathematical
physics
in
any
curvilinear
coordinate
system
requested
by
the
user
.
The
effectiveness
of
the
technique
is
demonstrated
by
using
it
to
derive
the
Navier
-
Stokes
equations
of
fluid
motion
and
the
continuity
equation
.
To
derive
these
equations
by
this
method
,
the
user
need
know
only
the
coordinate
transformation
equations
relating
the
curvilinear
coordinates
of
interest
to
an
orthogonal
Cartesian
triad
.
When
this
program
is
used
and
the
coordinate
transformation
equations
are
supplied
as
input
,
the
computer
will
derive
the
Navier
-
Stokes
equations
and
the
continuity
equation
.
The
equations
obtained
will
be
relative
to
the
curvilinear
coordinate
system
specified
by
the
transformation
equations
used
as
input
.
In
this
paper
the
emphasis
is
on
theoretical
considerations
and
methodology
rather
than
on
programming
details
.
Results
are
presented
for
cylindrical

Using

.W
The
practical
application
of
the
theory
of
finite
-
state
automata
to
automatically
generate
lexical
processors
is
dealt
with
in
this
tutorial
article
by
the
use
of
the
AED
RWORD
system
,
developed
at
M
.
I
.
T
.
as
part
of
the
AED
-
1
system
.
This
system
accepts
as
input
description
of
the
multicharacter
items
or
of
words
allowable
in
a
language
given
in
terms
of
a
subset
of
regular
expressions
.
The
output
of
the
system
is
a
lexical
processor
which
reads
a
string
of
characters
and
combines
them
into
the
items
as
defined
by
the
regular
expressions
.
Each
output
item
is
identified
by
a
code
number
together
with
a
pointer
to
a
block
of
storage
containing
the
characters
and
character
count
in
the
item
.
The
processors
produced
by
the
system
are
based
on
finite
-
state
machines
.
Each
state
of
a
"
machine
"
corresponds
to
a
unique
condition
in
the
lexical
processing
of
a
character
string
.
At
each
state
a
character
is
read
,
and
the
machine
changes
to
a
new
state
.
At
each
transition
appropriate
actions
are
taken
based
on
the
particular
character
read
.
The
system
has
been
in
operation
since
1966
,
and
processors
generated
have
compared
favorably
in
speed
to
carefully
hand
-
coded
programs
to
accomplish
the
same
task
.
Lexical
processors
for
AED
-
O
and
MAD
are
among
the
many
which
have
been
produced
.
The
techniques
employed
are
independent
of
the
nature
of
the
items
being
evaluated
.
If
the
word
"
events
"
is
substituted
for
character
string
,
these
processors
may
be
described
as
generalized
decision
-
making
mechanisms
based
upon
an
ordered
sequence
of
events
.
This
allows
the
system
to
be
used
in
a
range
of
applications
outside
the
area
of
lexical
processing
.
However
convenient
these
advantages
may
be
,
speed
is
the
most
important
consideration
.
In
designing
a
system
for
automatic
generation
of
a
lexical
processor
,
the
goal
was
a
processor
which
completely
eliminated
backup
or
rereading
,
which
was
nearly
as
fast
as
hand
-
coded
processors
,
which
would
analyze
the
language
and
detect
errors
,
and
which
would
be
convenient
and
easy
to
use

of
a
system
to
alleviate
the
problem
of

for
the
linguist
in
the
area
of
phonology
are
presented
.
It

,
to
define
data
as

,
to
test
the
effect
of
applying
rules
to
the
data
,
and
to

both
the

was
implemented
by
translating
linguistic
rules
to

The
system
of
program

that
has
been
in
use
on
the
Rice
University
computer
for
five
years
is
described
.
Each
logical
entity
in
storage
occupies
a
block
of
consecutive
memory
locations
.
Each
block
is
labeled
by
a
codeword
and
may
contain
a
program
,
a
data
vector
,
or
codewords
which
in
turn
label
blocks
to
form

.
This
storage
arrangement
is
discussed
with
its

simplicity

Ambiguity
in
Limited
Entry
Decision
Tables
Limited+Entry
Entry+Decision
Decision+Tables
.W
The
use
of
decision
tables
as
a
tool
in
systems
analysis
and
for
program
specification
is
now
becoming
accepted
.
Rules
on
redundancy
,
contradiction
,
and
completeness
for
limited
entry
tables
were
published
in
1963
.
These
are
usually
used
for
checking
,
preceded
if
necessary
by
a
conversion
from
extended
to
limited
entry
form
.
Processors
which
automatically
translate
tables
to
more
conventional
program
usually
base
their
diagnostic
facilities
on
these
rules
.
In
this
paper
it
is
suggested
that
these
rules
are
unsatisfactory
and
that
the
important
aspect
of
checking
is
to
eliminate
ambiguity
from
tables
.
Ambiguity
is
defined
and
discussed
,
and
a
procedure
for
producing
checked
-
out
decision
tables
is
proposed
.
The
theoretical
basis
of
the
algorithm
used
is
established
.
The
importance
of
well
-
designed
diagnostic
facilities
in
decision
table
processors
is
emphasized
.

.W
The
ability
of
a
computer
system
to
communicate
with
the
outside
world
efficiently
is
as
important
as
its
ability
to
perform
computations
efficiently
.
It
is
quite
difficult
to
characterize
a
particular
user
,
but
rather
easy
to
characterize
the
entire
user
community
.
Based
on
the
properties
of
this
community
we
have
postulated
a
hypothetical
"
virtual
console
.
"
No
claim
is
made
that
a
virtual
console
behaves
like
any
actual
console
,
but
the
entire
collection
of
virtual
consoles
models
the
collection
of
actual
consoles
.
Using
the
model
we
answer
questions
like
:
How
many
processes
are
suspended
waiting
for
console
input
?
What
is
the
maximum
rate
at
which
a
process
can
execute
?
What
bounds
can
be
set
on
overall
buffer
requirements
?
Answers
to
these
and
similar
questions
are
needed
in
certain
aspects
of
operating
system
design

The
"

idea
from
punched

information
retrieval
methods
has
been
mated
with
the
idea
of
superimposed

to
produce
a
programming
technique
which
cuts
computer
run
time
in
half
on
a
test
search
of
33,000
subject
index
entries
.
A
search
program
using
the
device
has
been
operational
since
late
1963
.
As
an
item
is
entered
in
the
store
,
an
18

byte
mask
is
created
from
the
item
's
meaningful
words
using
the
inclusive
OR
operation
.
If
,
at
search
time
,
the
logical
product
(
using
the
AND
operation
)
of
this
mask
and
a
similarly
constructed
question
mask
is
not
equal
to
the
question
mask
,
then
one
or
more
question
words
are
not
present
in
the

item
.
An
equality
is
in
conclusive
;
the
words
of
the
store
item
must
be
unpacked
and
compared
with
question
words
.
The

is
made
up
of

estimated
to

60

by
a

language
.
Explicit
standardization
of
the
language
is
undertaken
at
the
organizational
source
of
the

.
Use
of
the
organizational
trademark
(
TRAC
)
on
the
published
standards
,
and
services
relying
upon
them
,
provides
a
reliable
public

.
These

can
be
usefully
applied
to
other

up
a

The
computational
technique
conventionally
used
for
stepwise
multiple
linear
regression
requires
the
storage
of
an
n
X
n
matrix
of
data
.
When
the
number
of
variables
,
n
,
is
large
,
this
requirement
taxes
the
storage
capacity
of
presently
used
machinery
.
The
near
symmetry
of
the
matrices
involved
permits
a
modification
requiring
only
half
the
storage
and
computations
of
the
conventional
algorithm
and
this
additional
storage
allows
the
analysis
of
problems
containing
more
variables
.
Alternatively
,
it
permits
the
analysis
of
problems
containing
the
same
number
of
variables
but
with
all
computations
performed
in
double
precision

Proof

Retrieval
Theorem
for

A+Simple
Simple+Proof
Retrieval+Theorem
Associative+Memories
.W
An
efficient
method
of
ordered
retrieval
of
binary
words
from
an
associative
memory
,
as
described
by
Lewin
,
is
based
on
the
use
of
special
readout
circuits
which
indicate
the
digit
values
present
in
the
individual
digit
columns
of
the
memory
.
Thus
the
circuits
indicate
whether
the
individual
digit
columns
contain
digits
of
both
values
,
or
of
only
one
value
,
or
contain
no
digits
at
all
(
i
.
e
.
that
the
memory
is
empty
)
.
The
use
of
these
circuits
,
which
in
this
paper
are
termed
column
value
indicators
,
reduces
considerably
the
number
of
memory
accesses
necessary
to
retrieve
in
order
a
number
of
distinct
words
from
the
memory
.
Lewin
proves
that
,
for
the
readout
by
the
described
method
of
m
distinct
binary
words
,
2m
-
1
memory
accesses
are
necessary
.
(
Thus
he
proves
that
the
number
of
necessary
memory
accesses
of
his
method
,
unlike
those
of
other
methods
,
is
independent
of
the
word
length
.

a

One
Way
of
Estimating
Frequencies
of
Jumps
in
a
Program
One+Way
Estimating+Frequencies
.W
For
the
segmentation
of
a
program
it
is
useful
to
have
a
reasonable
estimation
of
the
values
of
S
(
ij
)
,
where
S
(
ij
)
is
the
mean
value
of
the
number
of
jumps
from
the
i
-
th
instruction
on
to
the
j
-
th
instruction
in
the
run
time
.
In
the
cases
where
the
S
(
ij
)
are
estimated
directly
,
the
structure
of
the
whole
program
must
be
generally
taken
into
account
;
therefore
it
is
very
difficult
for
the
programmer
and
/
or
the
translator
to
obtain
a
good
estimation
of
the
S
(
ij
)
.
It
is
easier
to
estimate
not
S
(
ij
)
but
the
quantities
P
(
ij
)
=
S
(
ij
)
*
C
(
i
)
/
SUM
[
S
(
ij
)
,
j
=
1
,
N
]
,
where
C
(
i
)
is
an
arbitrary
positive
constant
for
each
i
.
Although
the
P
(
ij
)
are
,
for
each
i
,
proportional
to
S
(
ij
)
,
the
estimation
of
P
(
ij
)
is
easier
,
because
we
must
estimate
only
the
"
probabilities
"
of
events
where
instruction
i
is
executed
after
instruction
I
(
i
)
.
This
estimation
can
often
be
done
without
considering
the
structure
of
the
whole
program
.
In
the
first
part
of
the
paper
,
using
the
theory
of
the
Markov
chains
,
an
algorithm
for
the
computation
of
the
S
(
ij
)
from
the
P
(
ij
)
is
found
,
and
some
ways
of
obtaining
estimates
of
the
P
(
ij
)
are
given
.
In
the
second
part
a
variant
of
this
algorithm
is
derived
,
avoiding
the
necessity
of
computation
involving
large

Writing

Outline+Debugging

.W
Presently
available
online
debugging
routines
are
often
unsatisfactory
for
the
experienced
user
because
they
require
unnecessarily
rigid
and
complicated
typing
formats
,
make
it
difficult
for
the
user
to
correct
typing
errors
,
and
consume
excessive
memory
with
intricate
features
.
In
a
debugging
program
it
is
of
prime
importance
that
the
program
be
simple
,
flexible
,
and
highly
efficient
to
use
.
Communication
between
the
user
and
the
debugging
program
can
be
improved
by
using
certain
techniques
applicable
to
most
online
debugging
programs
.
These
techniques
are
presented
and
are
illustrated
by
their
use
in
OPAK
(
octal

)
,
a
debugging
program
coded
for
the

The

between
economy

and
incorporation
of
elegant

features
is
discussed

BRAD

The

The+Brookhaven
Brookhaven+Raster
Raster+Display
.W
A
multiconsole
computer
display
system
has
been
designed
that
provides
very
rich
displays
at
low
unit
cost
.
Each
BRAD
(
Brookhaven
Raster
Display
)
console
can
plot
tens
of
thousands
of
points
,
or
up
to
4000
characters
at
30
frames
per
second
.
After
an
initial
display
system
investment
of
$
50,000
each
display
,
with
teletype
,
costs
less
than
$
3,000
.
The
technique
employed
is
that
of
programmatically
generating
a
binary
image
of
the
desired
display
in
a
computer
.
The
image
is
written
on
a
rotating
drum
memory
.
Independent
read
heads
continuously
display
the
picture
,
which
is
generated
by
swept
horizontal
lines
.
A
standard
TV
monitor
serves
as
the
display
device
.
The
technique
has
two
drawbacks
.
A
computer
must
compute
any
image
to
be
displayed
.
Also
,
the
"
pointing
"
interaction
is
more
difficult
.
This
is
because
the
pointing
function
gives
only
the
coordinates
of
the
point
on
the
screen
.
The
inverse
of
the
map
generation
process
is
required
to
calculate
the
coordinates
of
the
point
on
the
screen
.
The
inverse

To

such

Facilitate+Debugging
.W
The
designer
of
a
computing
system
should
adopt
explicit
criteria
for
accepting
or
rejecting
proposed
system
features
.
Three
possible
criteria
of
this
kind
are
input
recordability
,
input
specifiability
,
and
asynchronous
reproducibility
of
output
.
These
criteria
imply
that
a
user
can
,
if
he
desires
,
either
know
or
control
all
the
influences
affecting
the
content
and
extent
of
his
computer
's
output
.
To
define
the
scope
of
the
criteria
,
the
notion
of
an
abstract
machine
of
a
programming
language
and
the
notion
of
a
virtual
computer
are
explained
.
Examples
of
applications
of
the
criteria
concern
the
reading
of
a

,
the
synchronization
of
parallel

,

A
collection
of
basic
ideas
is
presented
,
which
have
been
evolved
by
various
workers
over
the
past
four
years
to
provide
a
suitable
framework
for
the
design
and
analysis
of
multiprocessing
systems
.
The
notions
of
process
and
state
vector
are
discussed
,
and
the
nature
of
basic
operations
on
processes
is
considered
.
Some
of
the
connections
between
processes
and
protection
are
analyzed
.
A
very
general
approach
to
priority
-
oriented
scheduling
is
described
,
and
its
relationship
to
conventional
interrupt
systems
is
explained
.
Some
aspects
of
time
-
oriented
scheduling
are
considered
.
The
implementation
of
the
scheduling
mechanism
is
analyzed
in
detail
and
the
feasibility
of
embodying
it
in
hardware
established
.
Finally
,
several
methods
for
interlocking
the
execution
of
independent
processes
are
presented
and
compared
.

A
multiprogramming
system
is
described
in
which
all
activities
are
divided
over
a
number
of
sequential
processes
.
These
sequential
processes
are
placed
at
various
hierarchical
levels
,
in
each
of
which
one
or
more
independent
abstractions
have
been
implemented
.
The
hierarchical
structure
proved
to
be
vital
for
the
verification
of
the
logical
soundness
of
the
design
and
the
correctness
of
its
implementation

The
onward
sweep

automatic
processing
of
information
is
impeded
by
nine
principal
barriers
:
geography

cost
,
problem
complexity
,
man
-
machine
communication
,
inadequate
sensors
,
lack
of
understanding
,
distance
,
time
,
and
size
.
The
main
incentive
for
breaching
these
barriers
is
the
universal
need
for
processing
information
,
ever
more
urgent
as
the
greater
part
of
human
work
activity
changes
from
production
to
service
.
Computer
developments
in

,
time

,
education
,

are
judged
by
how
effectively
they

Education
and
increased

are
basic
to
all
progress
with
the

This
complex

powerful
tool
is
the
most
important
one
available

to
use
in

All
published
error
coefficients
for
estimating
quadrature
errors
for
analytic
functions
were
computed
on
the
assumption
that
the
quadrature
rule
was
exact
for
polynomials
up
to
a
given
degree
.
Since
these
rules
use
rounded
values
for
the
abscissas
and
weights
and
since
the
true
values
of
the
integrals
of
some
of
the
polynomials
in
question
have
an
infinite
binary
expression
,
the
quadrature
rule
is
not
exact
.
Hence
these
errors
must
be
taken
into
consideration
in
computing
practical
error
coefficients
.

Toward

.W
Many
efforts
have
been
made
to
develop
a
better
way
of
implementing
a
higher
level
programming
language
than
by
the
construction
of
a
whole
new
compiler
,
but
so
far
none
has
proved
generally
satisfactory
.
In
this
paper
,
it
is
contended
that
a
programming
language
is
best
described
functionally
as
a
body
of
macro
instructions
,
and
that
the
macro
call
constitutes
a
canonical
form
in
terms
of
which
a
programming
notation
may
be
described
.
A
supporting
discussion
of
the
logical
and
his
torical
role
of
the
macro
instruction
is
presented
.
Also
discussed
are
the
conflict
between
machine
independence
and
object
program
efficiency
,
and
the
question
of
where
the
greatest
difficulties
lie
in
compiler
construction

Multiprogramming
as
it
is
discussed
here
is
a
mode
of
computer
operation
in
which
two
or
more
programs
are
concurrently
in
processor
memory
and
proceeding
,
each
using
the
same
central
processor
unit
(
CPU
)
and
input
-
output
(
I
/
O
)
channels
.
These
programs
are
actually
proceeding
intermittently
and
singly
,
according
to
eligibility
(
readiness
to
proceed
)
and
priority
.
It
is
useful
to
be
able
to
represent
them
as
proceeding
continuously
and
simultaneously
,
each
at
an
effective
rate
,
which
may
be
a
fraction
of
that
which
it
would
enjoy
in
the
absence
of
the
other
programs
.
The
effective
progress
rate
of
each
program
is
sensitive
to
many
detailed
characteristics
of
itself
and
its
co
-
residents
and
simulation
has
been
the
best
available
method
of
predicting
it

On

The
downhill
method
is
a
numerical
method
for
solving
complex
equations
f
(
z
)
=
0
on
which
the
only
restriction
is
that
the
function
w
=
f
(
z
)
must
be
analytical
.
An
introduction
to
this
method
is
given
and
a
critical
review
of
relating
literature
is
presented
.
Although
in
theory
the
method
always
converges
,
it
is
shown
that
a
fundamental
dilemma
exists
which
may
cause
a
breakdown
in
practical
applications
.
To
avoid
this
difficulty
and
to
improve
the
rate
of
convergence
toward
a
root
,
some
modifications
of
the
original
method
are
proposed
and
a
program
(

Optimization
of
Expressions
in
Fortran
.W
A
method
of
optimizing
the
computation
of
arithmetic
and
indexing
expressions
of
a
Fortran
program
is
presented
.
The
method
is
based
on
a
linear
analysis
of
the
definition
points
of
the
variables
and
the
branching
and
DO
loop
structure
of
the
program
.
The
objectives
of
the
processing
are
(
1
)
to
eliminate
redundant
calculations
when
references
are
made
to
common
subexpression
values
,
(
2
)
to
remove
invariant
calculations
from
DO
loops
,
(
3
)
to
efficiently
compute
subscripts
containing
DO
iteration
variables
,
and
(
4
)
to
provide
efficient
index
register
usage
.
The
method
presented
requires
at
least
a
three
-
pass
compiler
,
the
second
of
which
is
scanned
backward
.
It
has
been
used
in
the
development
of
several
FORTRAN
compilers
that
have
proved
to
produce
excellent
object
code
without
significantly
reducing
the
compilation
speed

the

even

The

A
Case
Study
in
Programming
for
Parallel
-
Processors
A+Case
Case+Study
.W
An
affirmative
partial
answer
is
provided
to
the
question
of
whether
it
is
possible
to
program
parallel
-
processor
computing
systems
to
efficiently
decrease
execution
time
for
useful
problems
.
Parallel
-
processor
systems
are
multiprocessor
systems
in
which
several
of
the
processors
can
simultaneously
execute
separate
tasks
of
a
single
job
,
thus
cooperating
to
decrease
the
solution
time
of
a
computational
problem
.
The
processors
have
independent
instruction
counters
,
meaning
that
each
processor
executes
its
own
task
program
relatively
independently
of
the
other
processors
.
Communication
between
cooperating
processors
is
by
means
of
data
in
storage
shared
by
all
processors
.
A
program
for
the
determination
of
the
distribution
of
current
in
an
electrical
network
was
written
for
a
parallel
-
processor
computing
system
,
and
execution
of
this
program
was
simulated
.
The
data
gathered
from
simulation
runs
demonstrate
the
efficient
solution
of
this
problem
,
typical
of
a
large
class
of
important
problems
.
It
is
shown
that
,
with
proper

,

N

applied

while

actually
lead
to
an
increase
of

time
with
the
number
of
processors
.
Stability
of
the
method
of
solution
was
also
investigated

A

A+Practical
Practical+Method
Constructing+LR
.W
A
practical
method
for
constructing
LR
(
k
)
processors
is
developed
.
These
processors
are
capable
of
recognizing
and
parsing
an
input
during
a
single
no
-
backup
scan
in
a
number
of
steps
equal
to
the
length
of
the
input
plus
the
number
of
steps
in
its
derivation
.
The
technique
presented
here
is
based
on
the
original
method
described
by
Knuth
,
but
decreases
both
the
effort
required
to
construct
the
processor
and
the
size
of
the
processor
produced
.
This
procedure
involves
partitioning
the
given
grammar
into
a
number
of
smaller
parts
.
If
an
LR
(
k
)
processor
can
be
constructed
for
each
part
(
using
Knuth
's
algorithm
)
and
if
certain
conditions
relating
these
individual
processors
are
satisfied
,
then
an
LR
(
k
)
processor
for
the
entire
grammar
can
be
constructed
for
them
.
Using
this
procedure
,
an
LR
(
1
)
parser
for
ALGOL
has
been
obtained
.

A
software

facility
which
is
part
of
a
general
purpose
time

system
is
described
.
The
Date
Collection
Facility
(
DCF
)
has
been
implemented
in
the
Michigan
Terminal
System
(
MTS
)
for
the
System

360
model
67
.
It
exists
for
the
purpose
of
monitoring
operating
system
and
user
program
behavior
and
performance
.
The
overall
structure
of
MTS
is
outlined
in
order
to
explain
the
implementation
of
the
DCF
.
Events
in
the
system
are
identified
and
recorded
from
within
the
supervisor
,
and
dumped
to
magnetic
tape
by
an
auxiliary
program
for
off
-
line
processing
.
Events
in
user
programs
which
are
unrelated
to
system
actions
are
recorded
with
a
supervisor
call
.
The
time
of
occurrence
of
each
event
is
accurately
recorded
,
and
data
items
are
further
identified
by
job
and
type
.
The
overhead
associated
with
data
collection
and
its
interference
with
normal
jobs
is
carefully
analyzed
,
and
both
are
shown
to
be
minimal
.
Several
examples
are
given
of
information
obtained
with
the
facility
and
of
applications
in
which
it
has
been
useful
.
Some

University
for
the
CDC
G21
computer
,
which

a
general

,
batch

system
with

.
The
existing
G21
system
and
the
graphics
hardware
are
described
.
The
graphic
monitor
is
a
resident
auxiliary
monitor
which
provides
comprehensive
managerial
capability
over
the
graphical
system
in
response
to
commands
from
the
human
user
.
It
also
will
respond
to
commands
from
a
user
program
through
a
similar
interface
,
where
routine
calls
take
the
place
of
manual
actions
.
Thus
the
human
and
program
can
interact
on
a
symmetrical
and
equal
basis
through
the
medium
of
the
graphic
monitor
.
The
choice
made
in
designing
the
graphic
monitor
,
given
the

.W
An
alternative
approach
to
the
design
and
organization
of
a
general
purpose
interactive
multiterminal
computing
system
is
presented
.
The
system
organization
described
is
a
conceptually
simple
arrangement
of
a
bank
of
interchangeable
computers
,
each
of
which
is
a
memory
/
processor
pair
,
that
are
assigned
to
process
terminal
jobs
as
they
arrive
.
One
of
the
computers
serves
as
the
master
or
control
computer
and
supervises
the
collection
and
distribution
of
messages
from
and
to
the
remote
terminals
.
In
the
simplest
form
there
is
a
disk
drive
for
each
connected
terminal
.
A
crosspoint
switching
network
allows
any
such
disk
drive
to
be
connected
to
any
computer
.
Thus
,
while
each
active
terminal
user
"
occupies
"
a
dedicated
disk
drive
,
he
may
share
the
computer
with
many
other
terminal
users
in
a
simple
manner
.
The
ratio
of
users
to
computers
is
dependent
on
both
the
size
and
power
of
the
machines
used
and
the
computation
requirements
of
the
particular
mix
of
users
.
This
system
organization
is
inherently
a
simpler
and
therefore
more
reliable
approach
to
time
-
sharing
computers
and
has
the
potential
of
a
highly
available
system
at
relatively
low
cost
.
Economic
configurations
are
possible
for
a
range
of
systems
sizes
that
span
at
least
one
order
of
magnitude
.
Finally
,
problem
programs
developed
by
remote
terminal
users
can
be
run
on
a
dedicated
batch
system
if
compatible
computers
are
used
.

a

A

A

that
overlay

incorporates
a

Some
of
the
problems
of
simulating
discrete
event
systems
,
particularly
computer
systems
,
on
a
conventional
digital
computer
are
dealt
with
.
The
systems
are
assumed
to
be
described
as
a
network
of
interconnected
sequential
processes
.
Briefly
reviewed
are
the
common
techniques
used
to
handle
such
simulations
when
simultaneous
events
do
not
occur
,
can
be
ignored
,
or
can
be
handled
by
simple
priority
rules
.
Following
this
,
the
problem
of
dealing
with
simultaneous
events
in
separate
processes
is
introduced
.
An
abstraction
of
this
problem
is
developed
which
admits
solution
for
a
majority
of
commonly
encountered
problems
.
The
technique
will
either
find
a
method
of
simulating
the
parallel
events
or
report
that
none
can
be
found
.
In
some
of
the
latter
cases
it
is
shown
to
be
possible
to
find
a
solution
by
extending
the
information
available
to
the
solution
technique
,
but
in
many
cases
the
technique
becomes
computationally
unfeasible
when
the
additional
information
is
provided

A
spanning

is
grown
and
the
vertices
examined
in
turn
,
unexamined
vertices
being
stored
in
a
pushdown
list
to
await
examination
.
One
stage
in
the
process
is
to
take
the
top
element
v
of
the
pushdown
list
and
examine
it
,
i

e

inspect
all
those
edges
(
v
,
z
)
of
the
graph
for
which
z
has
not
yet
been
examined
.
If
z
is
already
in
the
tree
,
a
fundamental
cycle
is
added
;
if
not
,
the
edge
(
v
,
z
)
is
placed
in
the
tree
.
There
is
exactly
one
such
stage
for
each
of
the
n
vertices
of
the
graph
.
For
large
n
,
the
store
required
in
creases
as
n
^
2
and
the
time
as
n
^
g
where
g
depends
on
the
type
of
graph
involved
.
g
is
bounded
below
by
2
and
above
by
3
,
and
it
is
shown
that
both
bounds
are
attained
.
In
terms
of
storage
our
algorithm
is
similar
to
that
of
Gotlieb

The

The+Teachable
Teachable+Language

The
Teachable
Language
Comprehender
(
TLC
)
is
a
program
designed
to
be
capable
of
being
taught
to
"
comprehend
"
English
text
.
When
text
which
the
program
has
not
seen
before
is
input
to
it
,
it
comprehends
that
text
by
correctly
relating
each
(
explicit
or
implicit
)
assertion
of
the
new
text
to
a
large
memory
.
This
memory
is
a
"
semantic
network
"
representing
factual
assertions
about
the
world
.
The
program
also
creates
copies
of
the
parts
of
its
memory
which
have
been
found
to
relate
to
the
new
text
,
adapting
and
combining
these
copies
to
represent
the
meaning
of
the
new
text
.
By
this
means
,
the
meaning
of
all
text
the
program
successfully
comprehends
is
encoded
into
the
same
format
as
that
of
the
memory
.
In
this
form
it
can
be
added
into
the
memory
.
Both
factual
assertions
for
the
memory
and
the
capabilities
for
correctly
relating
text
to
the
memory
's
prior
content
are
to
be
taught
to
the
program
as
they
are
needed
.
TLC
presently
contains
a
relatively
small
number
of
examples
of
such
assertions
and
capabilities
,
but
within
the
system
,
notations
for
expressing
either
of
these
are
provided
.
Thus
the
program
now
corresponds
to
a
general
process
for
comprehending
language
,
and
it
provides
a
methodology
for
adding
the
additional
information
this
process
requires
to
actually
comprehend
text
of
any
particular
kind
.
The
memory
structure
and
comprehension
process
of
TLC
allow
new
factual
assertions
and
capabilities
for
relating
text
to
such
stored
assertions
to
generalize
automatically
.
That
is
,
once
such
an
assertion
or
capability
is
put
into
the
system
,
it
becomes
available
to
help
comprehend
a
great
many
other
sentences
in
the
future
.
Thus
the
addition
of
a
single
factual
assertion
or
linguistic
capability
will
often
provide
a
large
increment
in
TLC
's
effective
knowledge
of
the
world
and
in
its
overall
ability
to
comprehend
text
.
The
program
's
strategy
is
presented
as
a
general
theory
of
language
comprehension
.

to
universities
in
Argentina

during
November

describing

.
As
elsewhere
,
these

are
experiencing
student
discontent
with
the
status

and
the
solutions
they
are
attempting
contrast
:
Argentina
is
excluding
students
from
participating
in

government
;
Chile
is
allowing
such
participation
.
University
computing
service
and
academic
activities
are
limited

The
number
of
computers
is
small
and
so

none
larger
than
an
IBM

;
with
some
exception
,
computing

academic

are
rare
.
This
situation
is
by
no
means
attributable
to
those
responsible
for
computing
developments
,
who
strive
for
excellence
;
rather
the
"

.
Universities
,
especially
those
with

adapt
slowly
to

;
superimposed
are
the
severe

Consequently
,
in
the
absence
of

However

when

Two

Two

Prevention

Deadlocks
System+Deadlocks
.W
A
well
-
known
problem
in
the
design
of
operating
systems
is
the
selection
of
a
resource
allocation
policy
that
will
prevent
deadlock
.
Deadlock
is
the
situation
in
which
resources
have
been
allocated
to
various
tasks
in
such
a
way
that
none
of
the
tasks
can
continue
.
The
various
published
solutions
have
been
somewhat
restrictive
:
either
they
do
not
handle
the
problem
in
sufficient
generality
or
they
suggest
policies
which
will
on
occasion
refuse
a
request
which
could
have
been
safely
granted
.
Algorithms
are
presented
which
examine
a
request
in
the
light
of
the
current
allocation
of
resources
and
determine
whether
or
not
the
granting
of
the
request
will
introduce
the
possibility
of
a
deadlock
.
Proofs
given
in
the
appendixes
show
that
the
conditions
imposed
by
the
algorithms
are
both
necessary
and
sufficient
to
prevent
deadlock
.

algorithms
have
been
successfully
used

.W
One
consequence
of
the
reference

count
-
based
space
-
recovery
system
employed
by
SLIP
is
that
reentrant
list
structures
are
not
recovered
even
when
explicitly
erased
.
LISP
-
like
garbage
-
collection
schemes
are
free
of
this
impediment
.
They
however
,
depend
on
being
able
to
find
and
mark
nodes
that
are
reachable
from
program

By
tracing
all
descendants
from
program

may
then
be

SLIP
may
be
amended
to
mark
those
lists
for
which
the

wishes

Given
this
modification
,
a
LISP

A
Note
on
Storage
Fragmentation
and
Program
Segmentation
A+Note
Storage+Fragmentation
Program+Segmentation
.W
The
main
purpose
of
this
paper
is
the
presentation
of
some
of
the
results
of
a
series
of
simulation
experiments
investigating
the
phenomenon
of
storage
fragmentation
.
Two
different
types
of
storage
fragmentation
are
distinguished
:
(
1
)
external
fragmentation
,
namely
the
loss
in
storage
utilization
caused
by
the
inability
to
make
use
of
all
available
storage
after
it
has
been
fragmented
into
a
large
number
of
separate
blocks
;
and
(
2
)
internal
fragmentation
,
the
loss
of
utilization
caused
by
rounding
up
a
request
for
storage
,
rather
than
allocating
only
the
exact
number
of
words
required
.
The
most
striking
result
is
the
apparently
general
rule
that
rounding
up
requests
for
storage
,
to
reduce
the
number
of
different
sizes
of
blocks
coexisting
in
storage
,
causes
more
loss
of
storage
by
increased
internal
fragmentation
than
is
saved
by
decreased
external
fragmentation
.
Described
also
are
a
method
of
segment
allocation
and
an
accompanying
technique
for
segment
addressing
which
take
advantage
of
the
above
result
.
Evidence
is
presented
of
possible
advantages
of
the
method
over
conventional
paging
techniques
.

Given

finding
a
set
of
subexpressions
each
of
which
occurs
in
two
or
more
other
expressions
or
subexpressions
.
Once
all
the
factors
have
been
ascertained
,
a
sequencing
procedure
is
applied
which
orders
the
factors
and
expressions
such
that
all
information
is
computed
in
the
correct
sequence
and
factors
need
be
retained
in
memory
a
minimal
amount
of
time

An

then
executed
in
order
to
minimize
the
total

required
to
hold
the
results

.W
A
computer
simulation
program
which
deals
with
traffic
flows
in
the
network
of
a
large
area
is
described
.
Each
road
is
segmented
into
blocks
of
several
ten
-
meter
lengths
and
is
represented
by
a
bidirectional
list
in
computer

.
The
movement
of
cars
,
i
.
e
.
the
transfer
of
cars
from
one
block
to
the
next
,
is
expressed
by
a
proper
formula
.
This
formula
is
based
on
the
supposition
that
the
speed
of
cars
in
a
block
is
determined
only
by
the
density
of
cars
in
the
block
,
and
this
speed
-
versus
-
density
curve
is
empirically
given
the
numerical
values
.
This
simulation
scheme
has
its
excellent
point
in

it
possible
to

A
stereographic
display
terminal
has
been
produced
using
the
raster
display
(
BRAD
)
recently
developed
at
Brookhaven
.
The
system
uses
a
rotating
refresh
memory
to
feed
standard
television
monitors
.
To
produce
a
stereographic
display
the
computer
calculates
the
projected
video
images
of
an
object
,
viewed
from
two
separate
points
.
The
resulting
video
maps
are
stored
on
separate
refresh
bands
of
the
rotating
memory
.
The
two
output
signals
are
connected
to
separate
color
guns
of
a
color
television
monitor
,
thus
creating
a
superimposed
image
on
the
screen
.
Optical
separation
is
achieved
by
viewing
the
image
through
color
filters
.
The
display
is
interactive
and
can
be
viewed
by
a
large
group
of
people
at
the
same
time
.

A
computer
program
for
routing
interconnections
on
a
two
-

printed
circuit
board
with
a
regular
pattern
of
lines
,
pins
(
terminals
)
,
and
vias
(
feed
-
through
holes
)
is
described
.
In
this
program
,
each
interconnection
is
given
a
planned
routing
-
typically
,
down
from
the
upper
pin
,
through
a
via
,
and
horizontally
to
the
lower
pin
.
From
the
top
,
a
virtual
aperture
(
i
.
e
.
a
long
horizontal
slit
)
is
stepped
down
the
board
.
The
planned
routing
is
the
basis
for
rerouting
interconnections
within
the
aperture
to
resolve
conflicts
for
lines
and
vias
below
the
aperture
and
to
maximize
the
effective
line
usage
.
If
a
conflict
has
not
been
resolved
before
the
aperture
arrives
at
the
lower
pin
,
interconnections
are
deleted
to
resolve
the
conflict
.
Extensions
of
this
technique
to
the
control
of
crosstalk
between
routed
interconnections
and
to
the
problem

obtaining
100

.W
A
class
of
coordination
phenomena
in
natural
languages
is
considered
within
the
frame
work
of
transformational
theory
.
To
account
for
these
phenomena
it
is
proposed
that
certain
machinery
be
added
to
the
syntactic
component
of
a
transformational
grammar
.
This
machinery
includes
certain
rule
schemata
,
the
conditions
under
which
they
are
to
be
applied
,
and
conditions
determining
the
sequence
of
subtrees
on
which
they
are
to
be
performed
.
A
solution
to
the
syntactic
analysis
problem
for
this
class
of
grammars
is
outlined
.
Precise
specification
of
both
the
generative
procedure
of
this
paper
and
its
inverse
is
given
in
the
form
of
LISP
function

All
the
edges
of
the
objects
are
considered
sequentially
,
and
all
planes
which
hide
every
point
of
an
edge
are
found
.
The
computing
time
increases
roughly
as
the
square
of
the
number
of
edges
.
The
algorithm
takes
advantage
of
a
reduced
number
of
concave
points
and
automatically
recognizes
if
only
one
object
with
no
concave

is
considered
.
In

,
the
result
is
obtained
in

Extremely

Typically
,
this

which

The

for

using

considered
.
It

been

out
elsewhere
that
if

is
used
as
the
measure
of

,
optimal
results
are
not

when
the

It
is
shown
here
that
if
,
instead
,
the
so
-
called

error
is

,
then
a

is
optimal

Moreover
,
use
of

Sussenguth
suggests
in
a
paper
(
1963
)
that
a
file
should
be
organized
as
a
doubly
-
chained
tree
structure
if
it
is
necessary
both
to
search
and
to
update
frequently
.
Such
a
structure
provides
a
compromise
between
the
fast
search
/
slow
update
characteristics
of
binary
searching
and
the
slow
search
/
fast
update
characteristics
of
serial
searching
.
His
method
,
however
,
contains
the
limiting
restriction
that
all
terminal
nodes
lie
on
the
same
level
of
the
tree
.
This
paper
considers
the
effect
of
relaxing
this
restriction
.
First
,
trees
which
have
the
property
that
a
priori
the
filial
set
of
each
node
is
well
defined
are
studied
.
It
is
proved
that
coding
the
nodes
within
each
filial
set
with
respect
to
the
number
of
terminal
nodes
reachable
from
each
is
necessary
and
sufficient
to
guarantee
minimum
average
search
time
.
Then
the
more
general
case
(
that
is
,
where
the
entire
structure
of
the
tree
is
changeable
)
is
treated
.
A
procedure
is
developed
for
constructing
a
tree
with
a
minimum
average
search
time
.
A
simple
closed
expression
for
this
minimum
average
search
time
is
obtained
as
a
function
of
the
number
of
terminal
nodes
.
The
storage
capacity
required
to
implement
the
doubly
-
chained
tree
structure
on
a
digital
computer
is
also
determined
.
Finally
,
the
total
cost
of
the
structure
,
using
Sussenguth
's
cost
criterion
,
is
computed
.
It
is
shown
that
significant
improvements
in
both
the
average
search
time
and
the
total
cost
can
be
obtained
by
relaxing
Sussenguth
's
restriction
that
all
terminal
nodes
lie
on
the

level
of
the
tree

The
problem
of
producing
sentences
of
a
transformational
grammar
by
using
a
random
generator
to
create
phrase
structure
trees
for
input
to
the
lexical
insertion
and
transformational
phases
is
discussed
.
A
purely
random
generator
will
produce
base
trees
which
will
be
blocked
by
the
transformations
,
and
which
are
frequently
too
long
to
be
of
practical
interest
.
A
solution
is
offered
in
the
form
of
a
computer
program
which
allows
the
user
to
constrain
and
direct
the
generation
by
the
simple
but
powerful
device
of
restricted
subtrees
.
The
program
is
a
directed
random
generator
which
accepts
as
input
a
subtree
with
restrictions
and
produces
around
it
a
tree
which
satisfies
the
restrictions
and
is
ready
for
the
next
phase
of
the
grammar
.
The
underlying
linguistic
model
is
that
at
Noam
Chomsky
,
as
presented
in
Aspects
of

.
The
program
is

Algorithms

Determining

introduced
,
the

A
study
of
multiaccess
computer
communications
has
characterized
the
distributions
underlying
an
elementary
model
of
the
user
-
computer
interactive
process
.
The
model
used
is
elementary
in
the
sense
that
many
of
the
random
variables
that
generally
are
of
interest
in
computer
communications
studies
can
be
decomposed
into
the
elements
of
this
model
.
Data
were
examined
from
four
operational
multiaccess
systems
,
and
the
model
is
shown
to
be
robust
;
that
is
each
of
the
variables
of
the
model
has
the
same
distribution
independent
of
which
of
the
four
systems
is
being
examined
.
It
is
shown
that
the
gamma
distribution
can
be
used
to
describe
the
discrete
variables
.
Approximations
to

such
that
the

defined
to
be
the
sum
of
seek
time
plus

,
is
minimized
for
a
sort
using
mass

The
analysis
is
parameterized
in
terms
of
the
ratio
of
seek
time
to
the
time
it
takes
to
fill
available
core
with
records
,

the

in
units
of
core

;
and
thus
it
can
be
applied
to
any
conventional

combination
.
An
explicit
formula
for
total

is
derived
,
in
terms
of
the
parameters
,
which
correlates
very
well
with
the
total

calculated

The
functions
can
be

of
purposes
such
as
the
control
of
machine

designed
to
replace
the
use
of

popular

filing
scheme
(
or
inverted

is
described
.
Through
the
use

(
or

numbers
of
the
records
)
that
satisfy
different
combinations
of

"
it
is
possible
to
retrieve
all
keys
satisfying
any
input
query
derived
from
a
subset
of
fields
by
a
single
access
to
an

although
each
bucket
may
be
used
for
many
combinations
of
values
and
a
combination
of

may
be
required
for
a
given
query
.
The
method
which
,
in
its
degenerate
case
,
becomes
the
conventional
secondary
index
filing
scheme
works
similarly
but
has
the
following
advantages
:
(

)
the
elimination
of
multiple

in
many
cases
;
(

)
the
elimination
of

;
(

the
elimination
of
computer
time

perform

of

each
qualified

only
;
and
(

the
avoidance

when

appearing

as
to

Rather

,
we
can
develop
interactive

which
are
easy
to
use

also
take
advantage
of
the

of
the

as
well
as
some
special

systems
for
solving
problems
in

.
The
advantage
of
restricting

that

Increasing
the
Efficiency
of
Quicksort
.W
A
method
is
presented
for
the
analysis
of
various
generalizations
of
quicksort
.
The
average
asymptotic
number
of
comparisons
needed
is
shown
to
be
an
log
^
2
(
n
)
.
A
formula
is
derived
expressing
a
in
terms
of
the
probability
distribution
of
the
"
bound
"
of
a
partition
.
This
formula
assumes
a
particularly
simple
form
for
a
generalization
already
considered
by
Hoare
,
namely
,
choice
of
the
bound
as
median
of
a
random
sample
.
The
main
contribution
of
this
paper
is
another
generalization
of
quicksort
,
which
uses
a
bounding
interval
instead
of
a
single
element
as
bound
.
This
generalization
turns
out
to
be
easy
to
implement
in
a
computer
program
.
A
numerical
approximation
shows
that
a
=
1.140
for
this
version
of
quicksort
compared
with
1.386
for
the
original
.
This
implies
a
decrease
in
number
of
comparisons
of
18
percent
;
actual
tests
showed
about
15
percent
saving
in
computing
time
.

AMESPLOT
is
an
extensible
software
system
designed
to
make
the
display
of
data
as
simple
,
painless
,
and
neat
as
possible
.
The
system
described
is
hardware
-
independent
and
has
been
implemented
on
a
variety
of
installations
,
of
different
manufacturers
,
having
diverse
configurations
.
The
elements
common
to
all
types
of
data
plots
are
outlined
and
the
way
in
which
these
elements
may
be
combined
into
a
system
based
on
simple
modules
is
demonstrated
.
These
modules
are
specified
independently
and
are
independent
of
the
axis
systems
or
other
attributes
of
the
plot
.
This
enables
plots
of
any
complexity
to
be
constructed
by
adding
or
replacing
modules
.
The
basic
syntax
of
AMESPLOT
is
outlined
,
and
a
brief
description
is
given
of
its
current
utility
software
,
consisting
of
"
macros
"
to
produce
self
-
scaled
plots
,
formal
tablets
of
text
-
interspersed
with
subplots
,
map
coastlines
,
and
3
-
D
plots
.
The
system
was
formulate
d
in
a
way
such
that
the
user
could
supply
the
minimum
of
information
,
and
it
should
be
fully
integrable
with
user
's
program
written
in
most
conventional
higher
languages
.
The
functions
of
positioning
,
locating
,
and
scaling
(
in
the
layout
of
multiple
subplots
)
of
axes
,
labels
,
and
all
other
elements
of
the
plot
are
handled
automatically
by
the
software
system
unless
the
user
specifies
otherwise
.
The
structuring
of
plots
from
multiple
,
independent
,
self

contained
subplots
is
described

Transformation

,
scaling
,
rotation
,
or
shifting
of
entire
plots
or
subplots
by
the
action
of
one
or
more
simple
modules
is
possible
.
The
user
may
interact
freely
with
AMESPLOT
at
three
levels
,
enabling
him
to
construct
his
own
data
markers
,
alphabetic

The

,
intended
to
constitute
an
interface
between
designer
and
computer
during
various
steps
of

The
main
emphasis
is
given
to
the
description
of
the
features
of
the
two
high
level
user
oriented
languages
,
operating
at
different
levels
,
on
which
the
interaction
is
based
.
The
first
one
is
IMOL
,
an
interactive
monitor
language
,
which
is
designed
to
perform
the
overall
and
control
functions
of
the
software
system
;
its
design
criteria
provide
the
user
with
commands
which
are
both
simple
and
efficient
in
order
to
perform
all
the
functions
needed
in
computer

.
The
second
one
is
COIF
,
a
circuit
oriented
graphic

,
which
is
designed
to
describe
,
generate
,
and
manipulate
graphic
problem
specifications
;
it
is
an
extension
of
Fortran
with
graphic

,
so
that
the
designer
who

familiar
with
Fortran
need
not

a
new
language
.
The
application
to
computer

design
is
in
particular
examined
;
on
the
other
hand
,
the
adopted
design
criteria

sufficient

The
Allocation
of

Is
Pricing
the
Answer
?
The+Allocation
Computer+Resources
Is+Pricing
.W
The
widespread
use
of
complex
third
generation
computing
systems
has
led
to
a
much
broader
concern
about
the
means
by
which
the
resources
of
these
systems
are
allocated
among
the
user
community
.
One
means
that
is
suggested
more
and
more
frequently
is
a
pricing
procedure
.
In
this
paper
the
manner
in
which
one
would
like
to
allocate
computing
resources
is
considered
,
and
then
the
extent
to
which
a
pricing
mechanism
fits
this
mold
is
discussed
.
Inasmuch
as
pricing
must
serve
as
a
rationing
mechanism
at
times
,
consideration
is
given
to
the
means
by
which
prices
can
be
adjusted
flexibly
in
order
to
make
a
dynamic
allocation
of
resources
.
Consideration
is
also
given
to
the
means
by
which
users
can
be
insulated
from
the
harmful
effects
of
frequent
price
fluctuations
.
Although
the
subject
of
pricing
has
been
given
a
lot
of
attention
recently
,
a
number
of
misconceptions
persist
about
its
purpose
and
its
operation
.
An
attempt
is
made
to
clarify
some
of
these
misunderstandings
and
to
highlight
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
and
to
highlight
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
pricing
.
Two
illustrative
pricing
systems
are
also
discussed
in

to
demonstrate

of
pricing
in
quite

In
this
paper
trade

offs
among
certain
computational
factors
a
given
set
of
messages
.
Two
new
hash
-
coding
methods
are
examined
and
compared
with
a
particular
conventional
hash
-
coding
method
.
The
computational
factors
considered
are
the
size
of
the
hash
area
(
space
)
,
the
time
required
to
identify
a
message
as
a
nonmember
of
the
given
set
(
reject
time
)
,
and
an
allowable
error
frequency
.
The
new
methods
are
intended
to
reduce
the
amount
of
space
required
to
contain
the
hash
-
coded
information
from
that
associated
with
conventional
methods
.
The
reduction
in
space
is
accomplished
by
exploiting
the
possibility
that
a
small
fraction
of
errors
of
commission
may
be
tolerable
in
some
applications
,
in
particular
,
applications
in
which
a
large
amount
of
data
is
involved
and
a
core
resident
hash
area
is
consequently
not
feasible
using
conventional
methods
.
In
such
applications
,
it
is
envisaged
that
overall
performance
could
be
improved
by
using
a
smaller
core
resident
hash
area
in
conjunction
with
the
new
methods
and
,
when
necessary
,
by
using
some
secondary
and
perhaps
time
-
consuming
test
to
"
catch
"
the
small
fraction
of
errors
associated
with
new
methods
.
An
example
is
discussed
which
illustrates
possible
areas
of
application
for
the
new
methods
.
Analysis
of
the
paradigm
problem
demonstrates
that
allowing
a
small
number
of
test
messages
to
be
falsely
identified
as
members
of
the
given
set
will
permit
a
much
smaller
hash
area
to
be
used
without
increasing
reject
time
.

LINC
which
provides
full
facilities
for
text
editing
,

(

which
can

The
QR
iteration
for
the
eigenvalues
of
a
symmetric
tridiagonal
matrix
can
be
accelerated
by
incorporating
a
sequence
of
origin
shifts
.
The
origin
shift
may
be
either
subtracted
directly
from
the
diagonal
elements
of
the
matrix
or
incorporated
by
means
of
an
implicit
algorithm
.
Both
methods
have
drawbacks
:
the
direct
method
can
unnecessarily
degrade
small
eigenvalues
,
while
the
implicit
method
can
effectively
loose
the
shift
and
thereby
retard
the
convergence
.
This

a
new
method

has
neither

tabulates
the

count
them

The
use

execution

diagnostics
in
pinpointing
ambiguities
in

is
discussed

It
is
pointed
out
that
any
attempt
at
resolving
ambiguities
at

will
,
in

be
impossible

It

that
,
as

,
tree
methods
of
converting
decision
tables
to
programs
are
inadequate
in

detection

Two
algorithms
for
programming
decision
tables
whose
merits
are
simplicity
of
implementation
and
detection
of
ambiguities
at
execution
time
are
presented
.
The
first
algorithm
is
for
limited
entry
decision

clarifies
the
importance
of
proper
coding
of
the

A+Simple
Simple+Typeless
Typeless+Language
Language+Based
Reference+Concept
.W
GEDANKEN
is
an
experimental
programming
language
with
the
following
characteristics
.
(
1
)
Any
value
which
is
permitted
in
some
context
of
the
language
is
permissible
in
any
other
meaningful
context
.
In
particular
,
functions
and
labels
are
permissible
results
of
functions
and
values
of
variables
.
(
2
)
Assignment
and
indirect
addressing
are
formalized
by
introducing
values
,
called
reference
,
which
in
turn
possess
other
values
.
The
assignment
operation
always
affects
the
relation
between
some
reference
and
its
value
,
(
3
)
All
compound
data
structures
are
treated
as
functions
.
(
4
)
Type
declarations
are
not
permitted
.
The
functional
approach
to
data
structures
and
the
use
of
references
insure
that
any
process
which
accepts
some
data
structure
will
accept
any
logically
equivalent
structure
,
regardless
of
its
internal
representation
.
More
generally
,
any
data
structure
may
be
implicit
;
i
.
e
.
it
may
be
specified
by
giving
an
arbitrary
algorithm
for
computing
or
accessing
its
components
.
The
existence
of
label
variables
permits
the
construction
of
coroutines
,
quasi
-
parallel
processes
,
and
other
unorthodox
control
mechanisms
.
A
variety
of
programming
examples
illustrates
the
generality
of
the
language
.
Limitations
and
possible
extensions
are
discussed
briefly

An

Of

An+Algorithm
Construction+Of
Of+Bounded

.W
An
algorithm
is
described
which
accepts
an
arbitrary
context
-
free
grammar
and
constructs
a
bounded
-
context
parser
for
it
whenever
such
a
parser
exists
.
In
the
first
part
of
the
paper
the
definition
of
a
context
-
free
grammar
and
the
working
of
a
bounded
-
context
parser
are
recalled
.
The
notion
of
reduction
class
for
a
context
-
free
grammar
is
then
introduced
and
its
connection
with
the
structure
of
a
bounded
-
context
parser
is
indicated
.
Next
,
pushdown
automata
which
generate
the
different
reduction
classes
of
a
context
-
free
grammar
are
defined
.
Finally
,
the
algorithm
is
described
;
it
essentially
carries
out
an
exhaustive
study
of
all
possible
runs
of
the
pushdown
automata
generating
the
reduction
classes
.
In
the
second
part
,
the
utility
of
the
algorithm
is
discuss
ed
in
the
light
of
the
experience
gained
from
its
use
in
compiler
design
.
The
algorithm
is
claimed
to
be
particularly
useful
in
the
simultaneous
design
of
a
language
and
a
compiler
for
it
.

Operations

Generalized+Arrays

.W
Operations
on
vectors
,
matrices
,
and
higher
dimensional
storage
arrays
are
standard
features
of
most
compilers
today
.
The
elements
of
such
structures
are
usually
restricted
to
be
scalars
.
For
many
sophisticated
applications
this
restriction
can
impose
cumbersome
data
representations
.
An
efficient
system
has
been
devised
and
implemented
which
allows
the
elements
of
multidimensional
arrays
to
themselves
be
multidimensional
arrays
.
This
system
was
developed
from
a
storage
structure
in
which
the
location
,
length
,
and
content
of
each
array
is
described
by
a
codeword
which
can
be
interpreted
by
the
system
.
Code
words
may
describe
arrays
containing
more
codewords
,
thus
providing
all
needed
descriptive
information
for
hyperstructures
of
any
form
.

As
an
example
,
the
methods
are
applied
to
the

The
system
is
separated
into
four
programming
tasks
:
picture

,
picture

,
and
display
management
.
Picture

.
A
prototype
data
format
for
pictures
,
called
a

,
is
developed
.
Structure
operators
are
defined
which
manipulate
picture

Many
of
the
ideas
are
taken

Examples

and
of
the

It

shown
that
the
use

greatly
facilitates
the
process
,
and
that
a

use

the
development

useful

The
M

N
procedure
is
an
improvement
to
the
mini
-
max
backing
-
up
procedure
widely
used
in
computer
program
for
game
-
playing
and
other
purposes
.
It
is
based
on
the
principle
that
it
is
desirable
to
have
many
options
when
making
decisions
in
the
face
of
uncertainty
.
The
mini
-
max
procedure
assigns
to
a
MAX
(
MIN
)
node
the
value
of
the
highest
(
lowest
)
valued
successor
to
that
node
.
The
M

N
procedure
assigns
to
a
MAX
(
MIN
)
node
some
function
of
the
M
(
N
)
highest
(
lowest
)
valued
successors
.
An
M
&
N
procedure
was
written
in
LISP
to
play
the
game
of
kalah
,
and
it
was
demonstrated
that
the
M
&
N
procedure
is
significantly
superior
to
the
mini
-
max
procedure
.
The
statistical
significance
of
important
conclusions
is
given
.
Since
information
on
statistical
significance
has
often
been
lacking
in
papers
on
computer
experiments
in
the
artificial
intelligence
field
,
these
experiments
can
perhaps
serve
as
a
model
for
future
work

Several
years
of
experience
have
led
to
the
belief
that
the
creative
design
and
evaluation
of
management
information
systems
requires
a
thorough
understanding
of
the
related
computer
technology
.
Concepts
such
as
paging
and
priority
interrupt
systems
can
best
be
explained
at
the
machine
language
level
.
Any
machine
used
for
exposition
should
fulfill
several
criteria
.
It
should
:
(
1
)
raise
as
few
spurious
issues
as
possible
;
(
2
)
allow
,
without
undue
effort
,
the
solution
of
interesting
problems
;
(

)
be
capable
of

(

A
syntactic
parser
is

for
hierarchical

in
the
form

linear

.
Particular
emphasis

the
system

"
significant

"
by
means
of
which
processing
times

large

matching
procedures
can
be
substantially
reduced

makes
frequent
use
of
examples
taken
from
the
fully

the
parser
in

in
such
a
way
that
the
individual
locations
of
bytes
and
bits
come
to
represent
the
data
involved
in
the
matching
procedure
,
the
shifting
of
information
is
reduced
to
a
minimum
,
and
the
searching
of
lists

The
matches
are
traced
by
means
of
binary
masks
and
the
state
of
single
bits
determines
the
operational
flow
of
the
procedure

The
method
could
be
implemented

interpretive
grammar

A

The

A

then
chosen

The

be
reduced
to

solved

the
methods
that
have

developed
for
syntactic

that
at

been
devised
for

questions
from

in

that
a

evolved
to
guide

in
the

Current

are
seen
to
be
effective

of

by
three

in

Although
the
use

structured
display

is
widespread
in
interactive
computer
graphics
,
these
structures
present
a
number
of
problems
which
tend
to
restrict
their
generality
and
usefulness
.
This
paper
discusses
some
of
these
problems
,
and
suggests
an
alternative
approach
to
display
system
design
which
avoids
the
use
of
structured
display
files
.
This
technique
employs
display
procedures
to
generate
information
for
display
.
By
including
transformations
within
calls
to
these
procedures
it
is
possible
both
to
simplify
the
specification
of
pictures
and
to
speed
up
their
generation
.
Display
procedures
permit
picture
elements
to
be
defined
conditionally
and
also
facilitate
the
processing
of
inputs
from

This
paper
presents
a
notation
and
formalism
for
describing
the
semantics
of
data
structures
.
This
is
based
on
directed
graphs
with
named
edges
and
transformations
on
these
graphs
.
In
addition
,
an
implementation
facility
is
described
which
could
be
part
of
a
programming
language
,
which
allows
a
programmer
who
has
expressed
the
semantics
of
an
algorithm
in
terms
of
the
graphs
to
then
specify
the
implementation
of
some
of
his
data
structures
in
order
to
gain

Canonical
Structure
in
Attribute
Based
File
Organization
Canonical+Structure
Attribute+Based
Based+File
File+Organization
.W
A
new
file
structure
for
attribute
based
retrieval
is
proposed
in
this
paper
.
It
allows
queries
involving
arbitrary
Boolean
functions
of
the
attribute
-
value
pairs
to
be
processed
without
taking
intersections
of
lists
.
The
structure
is
highly
dependent
on
the
way
in
which
the
file
is
to
be
used
and
is
uniquely
determined
by
the
specification
of
the
allowed
queries
.
Thus
,
for
example
,
the
structure
for
retrieval
on
the
basis
of
ranges
of
values
of
a
given
attribute
would
be
very
different
from
one
where
only
retrieval
on
the
basis
of
a
single
value
is
permitted
.
The
file
organization
being
proposed
is
based
on
the
atoms
of
a
Boolean
algebra
generated
by
the
queries
.
The
desirable
properties
claimed
for
this
structure
are
proved
,
and
file
maintenance
questions
are
discussed
.

Algebraic
Simplification

Algebraic+Simplification
A+Guide
.W
Algebraic
simplification
is
examined
first
from
the
point
of
view
of
a
user
who
needs
to
comprehend
a
large
expression
,
and
second
from
the
point
of
view
of
a
designer
who
wants
to
construct
a
useful
and
efficient
system
.
First
we
describe
various
techniques
akin
to
substitution
.
These
techniques
can
be
used
to
decrease
thesize
of
an
expression
and
make
it
more
intelligible
to
a
user
.
Then
we
delineate
the
spectrum
of
approaches
to
the
design
of
automatic
simplification
capabilities
in
an
algebraic
manipulation
system
.
Systems
are
divided
into
five
types
.
Each
type
provides
different
facilities
for
the
manipulation
and
simplification
of
expressions
.
Finally
we
discuss
some
of
the
theoretical
results
related
to
algebraic
simplification
.
We
describe
several
positive
results
about
the
existence
of
powerful
simplification
algorithms
and
the
number
-
theoretic
conjectures
on
which
they
rely
.
Results

Subexpression
Ordering
in
the
Execution
of
Arithmetic
Expressions
Subexpression+Ordering
Arithmetic+Expressions
.W
An
arithmetic
expression
can
often
be
broken
down
into
its
component
subexpressions
.
Depending
on
the
hardware
environment
in
which
the
expression
is
to
be
executed
,
these
subexpressions
can
be
evaluated
in
serials
,
in
parallel
,
or
in
a
combination
of
these
modes
.
This
paper
shows
that
expression
execution
time
can
be
minimized
only
if
consideration
is
given
to
the
ordering
of
the
subexpressions
.
In
particular
,
subexpressions
should
be
executed
in
order
of
decreasing
memory
and
processor
time
requirements
.
This
observation
is
valid
for
configurations
ranging
from
a
uniprocessor
with
an
unbuffered
main
memory
to
multiprocessor
with
a
"
cache
"
buffer
memory
.
If
the
number
of
subexpressions
which
can
be
executed
in
parallel
exceeds
the
number
of
available
processors
,
then
execution
of
some
of
these
subexpressions
must
be
postponed
.
A
procedure
is
given
which
combines
this
requirement
with
the
earlier
ordering
considerations
to
provide
an
optimal
execution
sequence
.

Buffer
Allocation
in
Merge
-
Sorting
Buffer+Allocation
.W
A
fixed
buffer
allocation
for
merge
-
sorting
is
presented
here
which
minimizes
the
number
of
input
-
output
operations
for
a
given
order
of
merge
.
When
sorting
on
movable
arm
disks
,
the
number
of
seeks
is
equal
to
the
number
of
input
-
output
operations
,
and
the
seek
time
usually
controls
the
sort
time
.
First
some
standard
terminology
is
introduced
.
Then
the
input
buffer
allocation
method
is
described
,
followed
by
an
analysis
of
the
improvement
to
be
expected
over
more
conventional
allocation
.
This
analysis
makes
use
of
a
particular
distribution
function
.
An
analysis
of
a
completely
different
distribution
is
given
which
yields
similar
results
.
This
suggests
that
the
results
do
not
depend
on
a
particular
distribution
function
.
An
optimum
output
buffer
size
is
also
determined
.
It
is
concluded
that
this
buffering
allocation
can
significantly
reduce
the
time
of
merge
sorting
on
movable
arm
disks
when
the
input
data
are
not
random
,
and
that
this
output
buffer
allocation
should
be
used
whether
the
data
is
random
or
not
.

An

a
Graph
An+Algorithm
.W
An
efficient
method
is
presented
for
finding
blocks
and
cutnodes
of
an
arbitrary
undirected
graph
.
The
graph
may
be
represented
either
(
i
)
as
an
ordered
list
of
edges
or
(
ii
)
as
a
packed
adjacency
matrix
.
If
w
denotes
the
word
length
of
the
machine
employed
,
the
storage
(
in
machine
words
)
required
for
a
graph
with
n
nodes
and
m
edges
increases
essentially
as
2
(
m

n
)
in
case
(

,
or
(
n

/

(

.
A
spanning
tree
with
labeled
edges
is
grown
,
two
edges
finally
bearing
different
labels
if
and
only
if
they
belong
to
different
blocks
.
For
both
representations
the
time
required
to
analyze
a
graph
on
n
nodes
increases
as
n

G
where
G
depends
on

,

Graspe
,
for

is
defined

Graspe
consists
of
a
type
of
directed
graph
data
structure
and
a
set
of
primitive
operations
for
manipulating
these
structures
.
Graspe
may
be
most
easily

by
embedding
it
in
a
host
language
.
Emphasis
is
placed
both
on
Graspe
itself
and
on
its
method
of
definition
.
Commonly
,
the
definition
of
a
language
involves
definition
of
the
syntactic
elements
and
explanation
of
the
meaning
to
be
assigned
them
(
the
semantics
)
.
The
definition
of
Graspe
here
is
solely
in
terms
of
its
semantics
;
that
is
,
the
data
structures
and
operations
are
defined
precisely
but
without
assignment
of
a
particular
syntactic
representation
.
Only
when
the
language
is
implemented
is
assignment
of
an
explicit
syntax
necessary
.
An
example
of
an

of
Graspe

On
the
Meaning
of
Names
in
Programming
Systems
Programming+Systems
.W
It
is
assumed
that
there
is
a
similarity
of
function
between
the
data
names
of
a
programming
language
and
the
file
names
of
an
operating
system
.
The
two
functions
are
discussed
in
terms
of
the
same
basic
concepts
in
order
to
identify
the
extent
to
which
they
overlap
.
It
is
suggested
that
there
is
some
similarity
between
the
idea
of
a
file
directory
and
a
storable
object
of
type
context
.
Manipulations
with
contexts
are
then
discussed
at
length
.
It
is
noted
that
there
is
a
simple
extension
of
Church
's
Lambda
notation
that
deals
nicely
with
these
ideas
of
context
manipulation
.
Whereas
a
function
can
be
regarded
as
the
abstraction
based
upon
the
first
two
terms
of
the
expression
Lambda
(
name
list
)
(
expression
)
(
value
list
)
,
it
is
found
that
a
context
can
be
viewed
as
an
abstraction
based
upon
the
first
two
terms
in
the
equivalent
expression

.W
In
this
paper
the
Ritz
-
Trefftz
algorithm
is
applied
to
the
computer
solution
of
the
state
regulator
problem
.
The
algorithm
represents
a
modification
of
the
Ritz
direct
method
and
is
designed
to
improve
the
speed
of
solution
and
the
storage
requirements
to
the
point
where
real
-
time
implementation
becomes
feasible
.
The
modification
is
shown
to
be
more
stable
computationally
than
the
traditional
Ritz
approach
.
The
first
concern
of
the
paper
is
to
describe
the
algorithm
and
establish
its
properties
as
a
valid
and
useful
numerical
technique
.
In
particular
such
useful
properties
as
definiteness
and
reasonableness
of
condition
are
established
for
the
method
.
The
second
part
of
the
paper
is
devoted
to
a
comparison
of
the
new
techniques
with
the
standard
procedure
of
numerically
integrating
a
matrix
Riccati
equation
to
determine
a
feedback
matrix
.
The
new
technique
is
shown
to
be
significantly
faster
for
comparable
accuracy

a

which
attempts

capture
broad

its

and
a

the

This

by
the
fact
that
change
is
an

Computer+Graphics
Graphics+Systems
.W
Display
system
designers
are
faced
with
the
difficult
task
of
selecting
major
subsystems
in
an
intelligent
way
.
Each
subsystem
is
chosen
from
large
numbers
of
alternatives
;
the
selection
is
based
on
considerations
such
as
system
response
time
,
system
cost
,
and
the
distribution
of
data
storage
and
processing
between
the
graphics
processor
and
its
supporting
data
processing
system
.
The
work
reported
here
develops
an
objective
,
quantitative
design
procedure
and
helps
give
a
better
understanding
of
now
to
configure
display
systems
.
This
is
accomplished
by
means
of
a
mathematical
model
of
a
computer
driven
graphics
system
.
The
parameters
of
the
model
are
functions
of
the
capabilities
of
the
graphics
hardware
and
of
the
computational
requirements
of
the
graphics
application
.
The
model
can
be
analyzed
using
numerical
queueing
analysis
or
simulation
to
obtain
an
average
response
time
prediction
.
By
combining
the
model
with
an
optimization
,
the
best
graphics
system
configuration
,
subject
to
a
cost
constraint
,
is
found
for
several
applications
.
The
optimum
configurations
are
in

An
algorithm
is
presented
for
minimizing
the
sum
of
the
lengths
of
the
blocks
of
coding
produced
by
an
assembler
or
compiler
when
(

the
length
of
each
computer
instruction
is
assumed
to
be
either
"
long
"
or
"
short
"
(

if
the

location
addressed
is
more
than
a
predetermined
distance
from
the
current

;
"

otherwise
)
,
and
(

)
there
are
blocks
of
instructions
whose
beginnings
(
origins
)
are
separated
by
prespecified
amounts
.
For
example
,
some
computers
permit
either
8

bit
addressing
(
interpreted
relative
to
the
location
counter
)
or
full

.
When
assembling

compiling
two

more
blocks
of
instructions
which
have
many
mutual
references
in
such
a
computer
,
there
is
no
simple
iterative
procedure
for
keeping
as
many
of
the

short
as
possible
.
This

demonstrates
that

.W
A
technique
for
recognizing
systems
of
lines
is
presented
.
In
this
technique
the
heuristic
of
the
problem
is
not
embedded
in
the
recognition
algorithm
but
is
expressed
in
a
figure
of
merit
.
A
multistage
decision
process
is
then
able
to
recognize
in
the
input
picture
the
optimal
system
of
lines
according
to
the
given
figure
of
merit
.
Due
to
the
global
approach
,
greater
flexibility
and
adequacy
in
the
particular
problem
is
achieved
.
The
relation
between
the
structure
of
the
figure
of
merit
and
the
complexity
of
the
optimization
process
is
then
discussed
.
The
method
described
is
suitable
for
parallel
processing
because
the
operations
relative
to
each
state
can
be
computed
in
parallel
,
and
the
number
of
stages
is
equal
to
the
length

if
the
approximate

is

.W
The
traveling
salesman
problem
belongs
to
an
important
class
of
scheduling
and
routing
problems
.
It
is
also
a
subproblem
in
solving
others
,
such
as
the
warehouse
distribution
problem
.
It
has
been
attacked
by
many
mathematical
methods
with
but
meager
success
.
Only
for
special
forms
of
the
problem
or
for
problems
with
a
moderate
number
of
points
can
it
be
solved
exactly
,
even
if
very
large
amounts
of
computer
time
are
used
.
Heuristic
procedures
have
been
proposed
and
tested
with
only
slightly
better
results
.
This
paper
describes
a
computer
aided
heuristic
technique
which
uses
only
a
modest
amount
of
computer
time
in
real
-
time
to
solve
large
(
100
-
200
)
point
problems
.
This
technique
takes
advantage
of
both
the
computer
's
and
the
human
's
problem
-
solving
abilities
.
The
computer
is
not
asked
to
solve
the
problem
in
a
brute
force
way
as
in
many
of
today
's
heuristics
,
but
it
is
asked
to
organize
the
data
for
the
human
so
that
the
human
can
solve
the
problem
easily
.
The
technique
used
in
this
paper
seems
to
point
to
new
directions
in
the
field
of
man

machine
interaction
and
in

.W
One
of
the
suggested
means
for
stimulating
the
spread
of
computing
capabilities
in
institutions
of
higher
learning
is
through
the
construction
of
regional
computing
networks
.
One
such
network
has
been
constructed
in
the
San
Francisco
Bay
Area
by
Stanford
University
.
This
paper
reports
upon
the
lessons
learned
from
the
operation
of
the
network
over
the
past
two
years
.
A
major
impact
of
the
network
was
not
so
much
the
computer
power
delivered
to
the
schools
as
the
awakening
of
computing
awareness
and
the
fostering
of
capability
development
at
these
schools
.
The
expertise
and
assistance
from
the
central
facility
as
well
as
the
sharing
of
ideas
among
the
participants
were
other
important
benefits
.
Both
the
quality
and
variety
of
services
provided
by
the
central
facility
were
found
to
play
a
key
role
in
the
effectiveness
of
the
network
.
A
regional
network
brings
many
benefits
and
should
not
be
judged
as
a
purveyor
of
raw

This

gives
a
review
of
the

discusses
the
differences
and

between
capabilities
found
in
host

and
those
found

.
After

the
problems

data
independence
and
binding
,
the
four
user
levels
are
identified
and
described
.
Technical
problems
facing
future
designers
are
described
.
The
first
of
these
is
that
of
handling
existing
stored
data
and
the
next
is
that
of
providing
more
complex
data
structures
than
those
already
available
in
conventional
programming
languages
.
The
problem
of
high
level
interrogation
and
update
functions
acting
on
network
structures
is
mentioned
,
followed
by
a
discussion
of
the
problem
of
catering
to
a
high
volume
of
transactions
initiated
from
terminals
by
parametric
users
-
the
lowest
level
of

.
The
use
of
Cobol
as
a
basis
for

is
considered
at
some
length
with
respect
to
data

The
division
algorithm
theorem
is
expressed
in
a
form
that
permits
it
to
serve
as
the
basis
for
devising
division
operations
that
produce
both
quotient
and
remainder
in
complement
form
.
Algorithms
for
division
yielding
complement
results
are
derived
for
numbers
represented
in
any
base
greater
than
one
.
Both
radix
and
radix

-

complementation
schemes
are
considered
.
The
binary
form
of
the
algorithms
thus
includes
both
two
's
and
one
's

.
The
problem
of

for

is
dealt
with
as
is
that
of
selecting
an
appropriate

of

Dynamic+Microprogramming

A
dynamically
microprogrammed
processor
is
characterized
by
a
small
(

-
bit
word
)
read
-
write
"
micro
"
storage
.
The
access
time
of
this
storage
is
similar
to
the
cycle
time
of
the
machine
(
50
-
100
nsec
)
.
This
microstorage
is
used
to
contain
both
data
and
subroutines
.
The
(
micro
)
instructions
in
such
a
processor
differ
from
the
conventional
in
that
they
perform
only
purely
combinatorial
operations
;
sequencing
is
under
the
control
of
the
microinstruction
.
The
presence
of
the
read
-
write
microstorage
permits
a
more
flexible
assignment
of
resources
than
the
read
-
only
storage
.
In
particular
,
the
processor
developed
in
this
paper
stresses
the
simultaneous
operation
(
within
the
microinstruction
)
of
the
adder
,
shifter
,
masker
,
and
testing
facilities
of
the
processor
.
A
microassembly
language
is
developed
and
the
overhead
involved
in
subroutine
linkages
is
analyzed
.
The
efficiency
of
a
flexible
software
linkage
scheme
is
examined
as
to
its
overhead
for
various
subroutine
characteristics
.
Finally
,
three
examples
of
problem
-
oriented

are
considered
and
the
resulting
coding
is
compared
against
a
System

The
utilization
of
storage
is
studied
in
a
two
-

memory
hierarchy
.
The
first
storage
level
,
which
is
the
fast
store
,
is
divided
into
a
number
of
storage
areas
.
When
an
entry
is
to
be
filed
in
the
hierarchy
,
a
hashing
algorithm
will
attempt
to
place
the
entry
into
one
of
these
areas
.
If
this
particular
area
is
full
,
then
the
entry
will
be
placed
into
the

,
even
though
other
areas
in
the
first

store
may
have
space
available
.
Given
the
N

have
been

an
expression
is
derived
for
the

An
elementary
outline
of
the
theorem
-
proving
approach
to
automatic
program
synthesis
is
given
,
without
dwelling
on
technical
details
.
The
method
is
illustrated
by
the
automatic
construction
of
both
recursive
and
iterative
programs
operating
on
natural
numbers
,
lists
,
and
trees
,
In
order
to
construct
a
program
satisfying
certain
specifications
a
theorem
induced
by
those
specifications
is
proved
,
and
the
desired
program
is
extracted
from
the
proof
.
The
same
technique
is
applied
to
transform
recursively
defined
functions
into
iterative
programs
,
frequently
with
a
major
gain
inefficiency
.
It
is
emphasized
that
in
order
to
construct
a
program
with
loops
or
with
recursion
,
the
principle
of
mathematical
induction
must
be
applied
.
The
relation
between
the
version
of
the
induction
rule
used
and
the
form
of
the
program
constructed
is
explored
in
some
detail

A
sequential

recognition

procedure
does
not
test
all

features
of
a

at
once
.
Instead
,
it
selects
a
feature
to
be
tested
.
After
receiving
the
result
of
that
test
,
the
procedure
either
classifies
the
unknown
pattern
or
selects
another
feature
to
be
tested
,
etc
.
Medical
diagnosis
is
an
example
of
SPR
.
In
this
paper
the
authors
suggest
that
SPR
be
viewed
as
a
one

person
game
played
against
nature
(
chance
)
.
Virtually
all
the
powerful
techniques
developed
for

strictly
competitive
game
trees
can
easily
be
incorporated
either
directly

by

In

,
one
can
incorporate
the
"

On

.W
An
integral
equation
is
derived
for
the
generating
function
for
binary
tree
values
,
the
values
reflecting
sorting
effort
.
The
analysis
does
not
assume
uniformly
distributed
branching
ratios
,
and
therefore
is
applicable
to
a
family
of
sorting
algorithms
discussed
by
Hoare
,
Singleton
,
and
van
Emden
.
The
solution
to
the
integral
equation
indicates
that
using
more
advanced
algorithms
in
the
family
makes
only
minor
reductions
in
the
expected
sorting
effort
,
but
substantially
reduces
the
variance
in
sorting
effort
.
Statistical
tests
of
the
values
of
several
thousand
trees
containing
up
to
10,000
points
have
given
first
,
second
,
and
third
moments
of
the
value
distribution
function
in
satisfactory
agreement
with
the
moments
computed
from
the

function

empirical
tests

results
for

An
automatic
learning
capability
has
been
developed
and
implemented
for
use
with
the
MULTIPLE
(
MULTIpurpose
Program
that
LEarns
)
heuristic
tree
-
searching
program
,
which
is
presently
being
applied
to
resolution
theorem
-

in
predicate
calculus
.
MULTIPLE
's
proving
program
(
PP
)
uses
two
evaluation
functions
to
guide
its
search
for
a
proof
of
whether
or
not
a
particular
goal
is
achievable
.
Thirteen
general
features
of
predicate
calculus
clauses
were
created
for
use
in
the
automatic
learning
of
better
evaluation
functions
for
PP
.
A
multiple
regression
program
was
used
to
produce
optimal
coefficients
for
linear
polynomial
functions
in
terms
of
the
features
.
Also
,
automatic
data
-
handling
routines
were
written
for
passing
data
between
the
learning
program
and
the
proving
program
,
and
for
analyzing
and
summarizing
results
.
Data
was
generally
collected
for
learning
(
regression
analysis
)
from
the
experience
of
PP
.
A
number
of
experiments
were
performed
to
test
the
effectiveness
and
generality
of
the
learning
program
.
Results
showed
that
the
learning
produced
dramatic
improvements
in
the
solutions
to
problems
which
were
in
the
same
domain
as
those
used
for
collection
learning
data
.
Learning
was
also
shown
to
generalize
successfully
to
domains
other
than
those
used
for
data
collection
.
Another
experiment
demonstrated
that
the
learning
program
could
simultaneously
improve
performance
on
problems
in
a
specific
domain
and
on
problems
in
a
variety
of
domains
.
Some
variations
of
the
learning
program
were
also
tested
.

It

that

Pattern
Width
at

Pattern+Width
Given+Angle
.W
That
the
pattern
feature
"
width
as
a
function
of
angle
"
possesses
several
possible
interpretations
is
demonstrated
in
this
paper
,
which
is
a
review
of
the
width
concept
in
pattern
recognition
and
the
geometrical
concept
itself
.
The
object
of
the
work
is
to
clarify
how
the
word
description
can
be
made
precise
so
that
computer
algorithms
for
feature
extraction
may
be
obtained
;
the
focus
is
on
the
theoretical
subject
matter
.
The
results
consist
of
a
set
-
theoretic
definition
of
width
-
at
-
angle
,
a
theorem
relating
it
to
the
pattern
boundary
radius
vector
,
and
descriptions
of
alternate
widths
.
All
widths
are
calculated
for
an
illustrative
example
;
graphical
and
tabular
comparisons
are
given
.
Substantial
variation
in
width
-
at
-
angle
magnitude
is
found
.
The
principal
conclusion
is
that
the
set
-
theoretic
width
-
at
-
angle
is
a
useful
pattern
feature
when
it
can
be
easily
computed
.
Further
investigation
of
the
information
contained
in
only
part
of
a
width
function
is
recommended
for
cases
where
computation
of
width
-
at

angle
is
difficult

have
been
the
subject
of
intensive
study
for
over
100
years
.
Generations
of
cryptanalysts
have
expended
untold
man
-
years
,
thus
far
without
success
,
attempting
tode
code
them
;
vast
armies
of
fortune
hunters
and
treasure
seekers
have
devoted
Herculean
labors
to
digging
up
the
rolling
hills
of
Virginia
trying
to
locate
the
promised
bonanza
.
The
history
of
pertinent
activities
would
fill
volumes
,
yet
serious
students
of
cryptography
have
always
had
nagging
doubts
about
the
cyphers
'
authenticity
.
It
has
been
alleged
that
the
"
known
solution
"
to
Cypher
Number
Two
:

"
)
with
the
aid
of
an
unsanitized
version
of
the
Declaration
of
Independence
was
merely
a
superb
,
imaginative
,
and
grandiose
hoax
perpetrated
ages
ago
for
whatever
reasons
.
Modern
computer
technology
could
obviously
perform
signature
analyses
the
process
of
encoding
itself
so
as
to
yield
new
clues
and
deeper
insights
into
their
construction
.
For
the
benefit
of
the
uninitiated
,
the
encoding
method
used
in
the
second
cypher
employs
a
specified
document
whose
words
are
simply
numbered
consecutively
,
and
first
letters
of
these
words
are
sought
out
at
random
to
match
the
letters
of
these
words
are
sought
out
at
random
to
match
the
letters
of
the
clear
text
or
message
.
The
sequence
of
numbers
corresponding
to
these
matches
is
then
written
down
as
the
final
code
.
While
primitive
,
the
process
has
the
advantage
of
relative
security
until
the
source
document
becomes
known
;
at
that
moment
the
cypher
can
be
decoded
even
by
second
graders
.
The
work
now
completed
with
the
help
of
our
UNIVAC
1108
includes
numerous
analytical
studies
of
the
Beale
cyphers
and
various
types
of
simulations
.
For
example
,
we
have
turned
the
entire
process
of
simulated
encoding
by
various
schemes
over
to
the
machine
and
analyzed
the
signatures
of
these
synthetic
codes
;
we
have
also
encoded
various
messages
by
hand
,
using
different
texts
and
a
variety
of
methods
to
obtain
their
signatures
.
These
simulations
provide
convincing
evidence
that
the
signatures
are
both
process
and
data
dependent
;
they
indicate
also
very
strongly
that
Mr
.
Beale
's
cyphers
are
for
real
and
that
it
is
merely
a
matter
of
time
before
someone
finds
the
correct
source
document
and
locates
the
right
vault
in
the
common
-
wealth
of

An
increasing
amount
of
software
is
being
implemented

A
popular
way
of
accomplishing
this
is
to
encode
the

then
to
map
this

into
the

of
each

The

the

a

The

used
in
dividing
the

A

both

It
is
shown
that
the

for
the

The

at

The

,
if

that
a

.W
A
method
of
incremental
compilation
is
presented
which
applies
especially
to
programming
languages
in
which
statements
can
be
nested
(
such
as
Algol
and
PL

)
.
The
method
permits
editing
of
the
source
language
using
a
general
purpose
text
editor
,
and
incremental
processing
of
changes
without
frequent
recompilation
of
entire
routines
.
The
essential
points
of
the
method
are
:
(
1
)
the
syntax
of
the
language
is
restricted
insof
ar
as
which
constructs
may
occur
on
lines
;
(
2
)
an
internal
data
structure
(
called
the
skeleton
)
is
maintained
to
represent
the
statement
structure
;
(
3
)
the
recompilation
is
partially
batched
in
the
sense
that
recompilation
of
modified
lines
does
not
occur
until
the
last
of
a
set
of
editing
commands
has
been
received
;
and
(

)
the
parsing
and
compilation
are
factored
into
two
parts

that
done
on

that
done

to
handle
the

.W
The
classical
process
of
partitioning
an
array
into
subarrays
is
extended
to
a
more
useful
array
language
operation
.
Various
modes
of
partitioning
are
defined
for
different
types
of
arrays
,
so
that
subarrays
may
vary
over
the
original
array
in
a
nearly
arbitrary
manner
.
These
definitions
are
motivated
with
several
realistic
examples
to
illustrate
the
value
of
partitioning
for
array
languages
.
Of
general
interest
is
the
data
structure
for
partitioning
.
This
consists
of
dynamic
tree
structures
which
are
used
to
derive
and
maintain
the
array
control
information
.
These
are
described
in
sufficient
detail
to
be
of
value
in
the
design
of
other
array
languages
.

is
based
on
the
inverse
function
of

Since
it

the

.W
Two
new
algorithms
for
deriving
optimal
and
near
-
optimal
flowcharts
from
limited
entry
decision
tables
are
presented
.
Both
take
into
account
rule
frequencies
and
the
time
needed
to
test
conditions
.
One
of
the
algorithms
,
called
the
optimum
-
finding
algorithm
,
leads
to
a
flowchart
which
truly
minimizes
execution
time
for
a
decision
table
in
which
simple
rules
are
already
contracted
to
complex
rules
.
The
other
one
,
called
the
optimum
-
approaching
algorithm
,
requires
many
fewer
calculations
but
does
not
necessarily
produce
the
optimum
flowchart
.
The
algorithms
are
first
derived
for
treating
decision
tables
not
containing
an
ELSE
-
rule
,
but
the
optimum
-
approaching
algorithm
is
shown
to
be
equally
valid
for
tables
including
such
a
rule
.
Both
algorithms
are
compared
with
existing
ones
and
are
applied
to
a
somewhat
large
decision
table
derived
from
a
real
case
.
From
this
comparison
two
conclusions
are
drawn
.
(
1
)
The
optimum
-
approaching
algorithm
will
usually
lead
to
better
results
than
comparable
existing
ones
and
will
not
require
more
,
but
usually
less
,
computation
time
.
(

)
In
general
,
the
greater
computation
effort
needed
for
applying
the
optimum
-
finding
algorithm
will
not
be
justified
by
the
small
reduction
in
execution
time
obtained

The
constructs
of
a
simple
programming
language
are
introduced
and
described
informally
in
terms
of
values
and
side
-
effects
.
A
translator
is
defined
which
translates
the
language
into
flowcharts
for
a
simple
machine
.
The
action
of
the
machine
in
executing
a
flowchart
is
defined
.
A
proof
is
constructed
that
the
effect
of
translating
and
executing
any
program
can
be
expressed
solely
in
terms
of
the
value
and
side

of
the
program
.
During
the
course
of
constructing
the
proof

formal
definitions
of
the
concepts
of
value
and
side

are
derived
in
order
to
make
the
proof
rigorous
.
Correctness
of

numbers
,
strings
,
labels
and
functions
)
.
For
correct
compilation
and
execution
,
the
following
question
then
arises
:
is
a
program
properly
constructed
so
that
its
operations
and
operands
are
compatible
?
The
activity
of
answering
this
question
is
usually
called
type
checking
.
This
paper
attempts
to
isolate
the
notion
of
type
checking
and
presents
a
partial
solution
to
the
type
checking
problem
based
on
the
notions
of
abstraction
and
application
of
functions
.
In
particular
,
a
program
is
mapped
into
an
expression
within
a
decidable
subset
of
the
Lambda
calculus
,
which
characterizes
the
type
relations
within
the
program
and
eliminates
all
other
information
.
The
determination
of
the
type
-
wise
correctness
or
incorrectness
of
the
program
is
resolved
by
reducing
its
corresponding
Lambda
calculus
expression
to
one
of
two
normal
forms
,
the
constant
"
correct
"
for
a
type
-
wise
correct
program
or
the
constant
"
error
"
.
An
application
to
type
checking
in
Algol

is
made
,
and
the
attendant
problems
faced
for
any
notion
of
type

are
discussed

A
system
is
described
for
generating
English
sentences
from
a
form
of
semantic
nets
in
which
the
nodes
are
word
-
sense
meanings
and
the
paths
are
primarily
deep
case
relations
.
The
grammar
used
by
the
system
is
in
the
form
of
a
network
that
imposes
an
ordering
on
a
set
of
syntactic
transformations
that
are
expressed
as
LISP
functions
.
The
generation
algorithm
uses
the
information
in
the
semantic
network
to
select
appropriate
generation
paths
through
the
grammar
.
The
system
is
designed
for
use
as
a
computational
tool
that
allows
a

to
develop
and
study
methods
for

Cellular
Arrays
for
the
Solution
of
Graph
Problems
Cellular+Arrays
Graph+Problems
.W
A
cellular
array
is
a
two
-
dimensional
,
checkerboard
type
interconnection
of
identical
modules
(
or
cells
)
,
where
each
cell
contains
a
few
bits
of
memory
and
a
small
amount
of
combinational
logic
,
and
communicates
mainly
with
its
immediate
neighbors
in
the
array
.
The
chief
computational
advantage
offered
by
cellular
arrays
is
the
improvement
in
speed
achieved
by
virtue
of
the
possibilities
for
parallel
processing
.
In
this
paper
it
is
shown
that
cellular
arrays
are
inherently
well
suited
for
the
solution
of
many
graph
problems
.
For
example
,
the
adjacency
matrix
of
a
graph
is
easily
mapped
onto
an
array
;
each
matrix
element
is
stored
in
one
cell
of
the
array
,
and
typical
row
and
column
operations
are
readily
implemented
by
simple
cell
logic
.
A
major
challenge
in
the
effective
use
of
cellular
arrays
for
the
solution
of
graph
problems
is
the
determination
of
algorithms
that
exploit
the
possibilities
for
parallelism
,
especially
for
problems
whose
solutions
appear
to
be
inherently
serial
.
In
particular
,
several
parallelized
algorithms
are
presented
for
the
solution
of
certain
spanning
tree
,
distance
,
and
path
problems
,
with
direct
applications
to
wire
routing
,
PERT
chart
analysis
,
and
the
analysis
of
many
types
of
networks
.
These
algorithms
exhibit
a
computation
time
that
in
many
cases
grows
at
a
rate
not
exceeding
log2
n
,
where
n
is
the
number
of
nodes
in
the
graph
.
Straightforward
cellular
implementations
of
the
well
-
known
serial
algorithms
for

problems
require
about
n

Computers
and
Employment
.W
The
relationship
of
computers
and
automation
to
employment
is
part
of
the
more
general
relation
of
technological
change
to
employment
.
The
most
obvious
effect
is
that
increase
in
productivity
due
to
technology
can
eliminate
jobs
.
Technology
affects
the
individual
worker
,
in
the
nature
and
amount
of
his
work
,
and
in
his
attitudes
toward
that
work
.
Technological
change
affects
the
occupational
structure
of
the
entire
labor
force
.
Because
of
the
central
importance
of
these
effects
,
the
impact
of
technology
has
been
the
subject
of
extensive
study
by
economists
,
sociologists
,
political
scientists
,
and
psychologists
.
Even
within
a
single
discipline
,
studies
are
often
contradictory
,
and
conclusions
are
colored
by
political
overtones
.
We
wish
to
delineate
some
of
the
issues

and
present
arguments
given

different

This
paper
presents
an
overview
of
a
number
of
system
features
which
the
author
feels
are
important
to
improve
the
productivity
of
programmers
working
in
such
domains
.
A
system
view
it
taken
,
rather
than
focusing
just
on
language
features
,
since
algorithms
must
be
not
only
coded
in
a
language
form
,
but
debugged
,
modified
,
made
efficient
,
and
run
on
data
.
Because
of
this
general
framework
,
the
requirements
specified
are
applicable
to
the
design
of
advanced
programming
systems
for
a
wide
range
of
applications
.
Three
aspects
of
programming
systems
are
highlighted
:
good
interactive
facilities
,
programmable
control
structures
,
and
sophisticated
data
communication
mechanisms
.
Interactive
features
are
described
to
facilitate
program
composition
,
entry
,
testing
,
debugging
,
editing
,
optimization
,
and
packaging
.
Implementation
of
a
generalized
environment
structure
model
specified
would
allow
programming
of
various
control
regimes
including
multiprocesses
,
coroutines
and
backtracking
.
Alternative
methods
of
procedure
invocation
required
include
invocation
by
pattern
and
by
monitoring
condition
.
The
need
for
extended
data
forms
,
storage
management
,
and
extensibility
are
stressed
,
as
is
the
duality
of
data
retrieval
and
function
evaluation
.
Syntax
directed
input
and
output
of
data
would
facilitate
use
of
complex

In

in

all

An
overview
of
the
current
and
future
positions
with
respect
to
operating
system
performance
is
given
.
While
a
great
deal
of
information
and
a
large
number
of
models
for
subsystems
have
been
developed
,
gaps
still
exist
in
out
knowledge
.
Because
of
the
severe
interactions
between
the
various
subsystems
of
an
operating
system
,
an
overall
model
of
the
total
system
must
be
developed
to
be
able
to
analyze
and
design
the
performance
aspects
of
an
operating
system
although
such
total
system
designs
are
exceptional
today
,
it
is
projected
that
they
will
become
increasingly
more
common
and
necessary
in
the
near
future
.
Such
a
design
philosophy
will
clearly
have
a
severe
impact
on
the
way
we
go
about
modularizing
operating
and
computer
systems

This
paper
presents
a
proposal
for
structured
representation
of
multiprogramming
in
a
high
level
language
.
The
notation
used
explicitly
associates
a
data
structure
shared
by
concurrent
processes
with
operations
defined
on
it
.
This
clarifies
the
meaning
of
programs
and
permits
a
large
class
of
time
-
dependent
errors
to
be
caught
at
compile
time
.
A
combination
of
critical
regions
and
event
variables
enables
the
programmer
to
control
scheduling
of
resources
among
competing
processes
to
any
degree
desired
.
These
concepts
are
sufficiently
safe
to
use
not
only
within
operating
systems
but
also
within
user
programs
.

Interference

Processes
Interference+Between
Between+Communicating
Communicating+Parallel
Parallel+Processes
.W
Various
kinds
of
interference
between
communicating
parallel
processes
have
been
examined
by
Dijkstra
,
Knuth
,
and
others
.
Solutions
have
been
given
for
the
mutual
exclusion
problem
and
associated
subproblems
,
in
the
form
of
parallel
programs
,
and
informal
proofs
of
correctness
have
been
given
for
these
solutions
.
In
this
paper
a
system
of
parallel
processes
is
regarded
as
a
machine
which
proceeds
from
one
state
S
(
i
.
e
.
a
collection
of
pertinent
data
values
and
process
configurations
)
to
a
next
state
S
'
in
accordance
with
a
transition
rule
S
--
>
S
'
.
A
set
of
such
rules
yields
sequences
of
states
,
which
dictate
the
system
's
behavior
.
The
mutual
exclusion
problem
and
the
associated
subproblems
are
formulated
as
questions
of
inclusion
between
sets
of
states
,
or
of
the
existence
of
certain
sequences
.
A
mechanical
proof
procedure
is
shown
,
which
will
either
verify
(
prove
the
correctness
of
)
or
discredit
(
prove
the
incorrectness
of
)
an
attempted
solution
,
with
respect
to
any
of
the
interference
properties
.
It
is
shown
how
to
calculate
transition
rules
from
the
"
partial
rules
"
by
which
the
individual
processes
operate
.
The
formation
of
partial
rules
and
the
calculation
of
transition
rules
are
both
applicable
to
hardware
processes
as
well
as
to
software
processes
,
and
symmetry
between
processes
is
not
required

Many

of
the
most
useful
capabilities
which
are
found
in
various
existing
techniques
.
A
proposal
is
presented
which
utilizes
several
of
the
best
capabilities
from
existing
schemes
and
is
complemented
by
several
additional
features
,
e

g
.
writable

The
writable
overlay
capability
provides
a
virtual
memory
effect
,
although
the
programmer
may
still
be
required
to
design
the
overlay
configuration
.
Since
overlay
structuring
is
a
complex
task
,
several
tools
(
including
a
graphic
display
)
are
included
in
the
proposal
in
order
to
aid
the
programmer
in
the
design

The

On
the
Optimization
of
Performance
of
Time
-
Sharing
Systems
by
Simulation
Sharing+Systems
.W
A
simulation
model
of
a
time
-
sharing
system
with
a
finite
noncontiguous
store
and
an
infinite
auxiliary
store
is
used
to
study
the
variation
of
system
parameters
such
as
store
size
,
number
of
jobs
allowed
to
execute
simultaneously
,
job
-
scheduling
algorithm
,
etc
.
The
effects
of
these
variations
on
a
measure
of
system
performance
is
used
to
ascertain
which
of
the
parameters
controllable
by
the
job
-
scheduling
algorithm
,
including
the
scheduling
itself
,
require
optimization
,
and
which
of
the
parameters
not
normally
controllable
by
the
scheduling
algorithm
have
a
marked
effect
on
system
performance
.
System
performance
is
based
upon
the
mean
cost
of
delay
to
all
jobs
processed
.
It
is
shown
that
significant
improvements
in
the
measure
of
system
performance
can
be
obtained
by
using
variable
time
-
slice
techniques
and
by
selecting
the
optimum
round
-
robin
cycle
time
.
It
appears
that
these
features
would
benefit
from
optimization
whereas
other
parameters
controllable
by
the
scheduling
algorithm
affect
system
performance
in
a
predictable
manner
and
would
not
benefit
from
optimization
.
Features
not
normally
under
the
control
of
the
scheduling
algorithm
can
also
have
a
marked
effect
on
the
measure
of
performance
;
in
particular
,
supervisor
overheads
,
the
size
of
the
store
,

the

was
described
and
how
each
quadrature
formula
used
in
the
scheme
requires
a
cosine

of

values
was
shown
.
The
high
cost
of
these
cosine
transformations
has
been
a
serious
drawback
in
using
Clenshaw
-
Curtis
quadrature
.
Two
other
problems
related
to
the
cosine
transformation
have
also
been
trouble
some
.
First
,
the
conventional
computation
of
the
cosine
transformation
by
recurrence
relation
is
numerically
unstable
,
particularly
at
the
low
frequencies
which
have
the
largest
effect
upon
the
integral
.
Second
,
in
case
the
automatic
scheme
should
require
refinement
of
the
sampling
,
storage
is
required
to
save
the
integrand
values
after
the
cosine
transformation
is
computed
.
This
second
part
of
the
paper
shows
how
the
cosine
transformation
can
be
computed
by
a
modification
of
the
fast
Fourier
transform
and
all
three
problems
overcome
.
The
modification
is
also
applicable
in
other
circumstances
requiring

or

,
such
as

Curtis
quadrature
is
a
particularly
important
automatic
quadrature
scheme
for
a
variety
of
reasons
,
especially
the
high
accuracy
obtained
from
relatively
few
integrand
values
.
However
,
it
has
received
little
use
because
it
requires
the
computation
of
a
cosine
transformation
and
the
arithmetic
cost
of
this
has
been
prohibitive
.
This

a

The

The+Multics
Multics+Virtual
Virtual+Memory
.W
As
experience
with
use
of
on
-
line
operating
systems
has
grown
,
the
need
to
share
information
among
system
users
has
become
increasingly
apparent
.
Many
contemporary
systems
permit
some
degree
of
sharing
.
Usually
,
sharing
is
accomplished
by
allowing
several
users
to
share
data
via
input
and
output
of
information
stored
in
files
kept
in
secondary
storage
.
Through
the
use
of
segmentation
,
however
,
Multics
provides
direct
hardware
addressing
by
user
and
system
programs
of
all
information
,
independent
of
its
physical
storage
location
.
Information
is
stored
in
segments
each
of
which
is
potentially
sharable
and
carries
its
own
independent
attributes
of
size
and
access
privilege
.
Here
,
the
design
and
implementation
considerations
of
segmentation
and
sharing
in
Multics
are
first
discussed
under
the
assumption
that
all
information
resides
in
large
,
segmented
main
memory
.
Since
the
size
of
main
memory
on
contemporary
systems
is
rather
limited
,
it
is
then
shown
how
the
Multics
software
achieves
the
effect
of
a
large
segmented
main
memory
through
the
use
of
the
Honeywell
645
segmentation
and
paging
hardware

The
Index
Sequential
Access
Method
(
ISAM
)
is
one
of
the
most
important
file
management
systems
used
with
moveable
head
disk
devices
.
This
study
investigates
the
use
of
an
unconventional
method
of
treating
overflow
records
.
The
method
is
to
use
hashing
techniques
to
allocate
space
for
such
records
.
If
certain
conditions
are
satisfied
,
this
is
superior
to
the
conventional
ISAM
method
of
chaining
the
overflow
records
via
linked
list
techniques
.
These
conditions
are
:
long
overflow
chains
with
significant
overflow
;
lack
of
tight
disk
space
constraints
;
record
keys
which
are
small
compared
to
the
total
record
size
;
and
significant
use
of
the
file
in
the
index
as
opposed
to
the
sequential
mode
.
Using
hashed
overflow
,
the
time
to
locate
a
record
is
dependent
not
on
the
total
volume
of
overflow
records
as
in
conventional
ISAM
,
but
on
the
percentage
use
of
space
dedicated
to
overflow
records
.

In

a

wins
Shannon
Switching

is
described
.
Since
these
games
are
played
on
graphs
,
the
program
is
a
good
example
of
the
implementation
of
graph

.
The
two
players
in
a
Shannon

,
CONNECT
and
CUT
,
have
nonsimilar

.
Either
CONNECT
,
CUT
,
or
the
player
moving
first
is
guaranteed
the
existence
of
a
winning
strategy
.
The
simple
strategy
explained
in
this

is
valid
in
all
three
cases
.
In

,
the
major

never

whether

A
method
is
presented
of
determining
which
parts
of
three
-
dimensional
objects
are
visible
and
which
are
invisible
when
the
objects
are
rotated
about
some
axis
.
This
paper
describes
a
polygon
comparison
scheme
in
which
the
relationships
of
two
polygons
can
be
classified
into
tree
types
,
and
also
discusses
how
the
relationship
is
changed
for
each
pair
of
polygons
under
rotation
about
some
axis
.
A
rotation
table
is
defined
for
each
pair
of
polygons
,
which
remains
fixed
as
long
as
rotation
is
about
one
axis
and
provides
a
means
of
rapidly
determining
the
visible
and
hidden
line
relationship
between
two
polygons
.
Additional
work
must
be
done
to
extend
this
approach
to
simultaneous
rotation
about
several
axes
.

The

may
be
represented

a
model
matrix
whose
elements
are
decision
rules
and
whose
row
and

A

of
four
functions
is
used
to

this

Distinguishing
between

enables
one
to
perform
much
of
the
checking
of
security
only
once
at

rather
than
repeatedly
at

The

Synchronization

Formalization

a
well

synchronization
mechanism

prove
that
concurrently
running
processes

communicate
correctly

This
is

a
system

many
sending

many
receiving
processes
which
remove
messages
from

The
formal
description

the

mechanism
makes
it
very
easy
to
prove
that
the
buffer
will
neither
overflow

underflow
,
that
senders

will
never
operate

Protection
of
computations
and
information
is
an
important
aspect
of
a
computer
utility
.
In
a
system
which
uses
segmentation
as
a
memory
addressing
scheme
,
protection
can
be
achieved
in
part
by
associating
concentric
rings
of
decreasing
access
privilege
with
a
computation
.
This
paper
describes
hardware
processor
mechanisms
for
implementing
these
rings
of
protection
.
The
mechanisms
for
implementing
these
rings
of
protection
.
The
mechanisms
allow
cross
-
ring
calls
and
subsequent
returns
to
occur
without
trapping
to
the
supervisor
.
Automatic
hardware
validation
of
references
across
ring
boundaries
is
also
performed
.
Thus
,
a
call
by
a
user
procedure
to
a
protected
subsystem
(
including
the
supervisor
)
is
identical
to
a
call
to
a
companion
user
procedure
.
The
mechanisms
of
passing
and
referencing
arguments
are
the
same
in
both
cases

An

the

-
schedules
active

provides
a
small

which
it

A

specify

the
part

supervisor
(

by
combining
these
primitives
into
a
"

The

which
executes
these

The
problem
discussed
is
that
of
simulating
human
composition
of
Western
popular
music
by
computer
and
some
relevant
theories
of
music
and
harmony
are
given
.
Problems
with
this
kind
of
program
and
several
schemes
that
are
known
not
to
work
are
discussed
.
Several
previous
computer
compositions
are
discussed
,
including
the
ILLIAC
Suite
.
A
program
to
generate
short
melody
fragments
was
written
to
simulate
some
of
the
aspects
of
human
composition
.
Five
samples
of
its
output
are
presented
and
discussed
.
It
was
discovered
that
although
the
fragments
show
many
of
the
characteristics
of
popular
melodies
,
they
have
a
strangely
alien
sound
.
It
is
theorized
that
this
is
because
the
relevant
probabilities
which
would
discriminate
against
unfamiliar
sequences
were
not
used
.

Because
of

created
by
the
explosion
of
papers
in

the
drawbacks
that

on

,
it
is
suggested
that
a
tree
of
all

results

terminology
be
maintained
in
a

computer
system
.
Users
of
the
system
can
store
in
the
computer
an
updated
file
of
their
current
knowledge
,
and
on
selecting
a
paper
to
read
,
they
can
obtain
from
the
computer
the
minimum
subtree
of
theorems
required
to
bring
them
from
what
they
already
know
to
the

the

sentences
of
unrestricted
content

The
model
first
applies
syntactic
analysis
to
eliminate
some
interpretations
and
then
employs
a
simplified
semantic
intersection
procedure
to
find
a
valid
interpretation
of
the
input
.
While
the
semantic
processing
is
similar
to
TLC
'
s
,
the
syntactic
component
includes
the
early
use
of
parse
trees
and
special
purpose
rules
.
The
"
relational

"
notation
used
during
interpretation
of
input
is
compatible
with
MUSE
'
s
memory
structures
,
allowing
direct
verification
of
familiar
concepts
and
the

a
repertoire

algorithm
for
shrinking
binary
patterns

single

one

the
very

,
the

the
cross
-
correlation
between
a
model
and
the
correct
structure
cannot
be
computed
because
of
a
fundamental
incompleteness
in
the
measured
data
.
However
,
it
is
possible
to
compute
an
upper
bound
to
such
a
cross

.
A
simple
example
demonstrates
that
this
information
can
be
the
basis
of
a
technique
for

determination
that
can
make
effective
use

Model
building

has
intrinsic
advantages
over
usual

based
on

the

A

Most
graphics
systems
using
a
raster
scan
output
device
(
CRT
or
hardcopy
)
maintain
a
display
file
in
the
XY
or
random
scan
format
.
Scan
converters
,
hardware
or
software
,
must
be
provided
to
translate
the
picture
description
from
the
XY
format
to
the
raster
format
.
Published
scan
conversion
algorithms
which
are
fast
will
reserve
a
buffer
area
large
enough
to
accommodate
the
entire
screen
.
On
the
other
hand
,
those
which
use
a
small
buffer
area
are
slow
because
they
require
multiple
passes
through
the
XY
display
file
.
The
scan
conversion
algorithm
described
here
uses
a
linked
list
data
structure
to
process
the
lines
of
the
drawing
in
strips
corresponding
to
groups
of
scan
lines
.
A
relatively
small
primary
memory
buffer
area
is
used
to
accumulate
the
binary
image
for
a
group
of
scan
lines
.
When
this
portion
of
the
drawing
has
been
plotted
,
the
buffer
is
reused
for
the
next
portion
.
Because
of
the
list
processing
procedures
used
,
only
a
single
pass
through
the
XY
display
file
is
required
when
generating
the
binary
image
and
only
a
slight
increase
in
execution
time
over
the
fully
buffered
core
results
.
Results

storage
requirements
can
be
reduced

while

Dynamic
Verification
of

Decisions
Dynamic+Verification
Operating+System
System+Decisions
.W
Dynamic
verification
of
a
decision
implies
that
every
time
the
decision
is
made
there
is
a
consistency
check
performed
on
the
decision
using
independent
hardware
and
software
.
The
dynamic
verification
of
operating
system
decisions
is
used
on
the
PRIME
system
being
designed
and
constructed
at
the
University
of
California
,
Berkeley
.
PRIME
is
an
experimental
time
-
sharing
which
is
to
have
the
properties
of
continuous
availability
,
data
privacy
,
and
cost
effectiveness
.
The
technique
of
dynamic
verification
allows
the
construction
of
an
operating
system
which
does
not
make
certain
decisions
improperly
even
in
the
presence
of
a
single
hardware
or
software
fault
.
Furthermore
,
multiple
faults
lead
to
unreliable
operation
only
if
the
faults
happen
to
reinforce
each
other
.
On
PRIME
,
dynamic
verification
is
used
to
ensure
that
one
user
's
information
cannot
become
available
to
another
user
gratuitously
even
in
the
presence
of
a
single
hardware
or
software
fault
.
the
amount
of
additional
hardware
and
software
required
for
dynamic
verification
can
be
modest

As
part
of
an
effort
to
design
and
implement
a
Fortran
compiler
on
the
ILLIAC
IV
,
an
extended
Fortran
,
called
IVTRAN
,
has
been
developed
.
This
language
provides
a
means
of
expressing
data
and
control
structures
suitable
for
exploiting
ILLIAC

.
This
paper
reviews
the
hardware
characteristics
of
the
ILLIAC
and
singles
out
unconventional
features
which
could
be
expected
to
influence
language
(
and
compiler
)
design
.
The
implications
of
these
features
for
data
layout
and
algorithm
structure
are
discussed
,
and
the
conclusion
is
drawn
that
data
allocation
rather
than
code
structuring
is
the
crucial
ILLIAC
optimization
problem
.
A
satisfactory
method
of
data

is
then
presented
.
Language

utilize
this

This

presents
a

to
the

of
performance
of
the

methods
.
In
this

the

assumed
to
have
been
selected
from
the
key
space
according
to
a
certain
probabilistic

algorithm
.
All

with
the

number
of
keys
selected
from
this
key
space
will
be
suitably
weighted
in

with
the
algorithm
,
and
the
average
performance
of
the
transformation
methods
on
these

will
be
used
as
the
potential
of
these

.
Using
this

,
methods
with
the

overall

can
be
classified
and
key
distributions
partial
to
certain

can
be
identified
.
All

The

is
applied

A
Model

Stack
Implementation
of
Multiple
Environments
A+Model
Stack+Implementation
Multiple+Environments
.W
Many
control
and
access
environment
structures
require
that
storage
for
a
procedure
activation
exist
at
times
when
control
is
not
nested
within
the
procedure
activated
.
This
is
straightforward
to
implement
by
dynamic
storage
allocation
with
linked
blocks
for
each
activation
,
but
rather
expensive
in
both
time
and
space
.
This
paper
presents
an
implementation
technique
using
a
single
stack
to
hold
procedure
activation
storage
which
allows
retention
of
that
storage
for
durations
not
necessarily
tied
to
control
flow
.
The
technique
has
the
property
that
,
in
the
simple
case
,
it
runs
identically
to
the
usual
automatic
stack
allocation
and
deallocation
procedure
.
Applications
of
this
technique
to
multitasking
,
coroutines
,
backtracking
,

variables
,
and
functional
arguments
are
discussed
.
In
the
initial
model
,
a
single
real
processor
is
assumed
,
and
the
implementation
assumes
multiple
-
processes
coordinate
by
passing
control
explicitly
to
one
another
.
A
multiprocessor
implementation
requires
only
a
few
changes
to
the
basic
technique

as
described

Design
of
Tree

for

Tree+Structures
Efficient+Querying
.W
A
standard
information
retrieval
operation
is
to
determine
which
records
in
a
data
collection
satisfy
a
given
query
expressed
in
terms
of
data
values
.
The
process
of
locating
the
desired
responses
can
be
represented
by
a
tree
search
model
.
This
paper
poses
an
optimization
problem
in
the
design
of
such
trees
to
serve
a
well
-
specified
application
.
The
problem
is
academic
in
the
sense
that
ordinarily
the
optimal
tree
cannot
be
implemented
by
means
of
practical
techniques
.
On
the
other
hand
,
it
is
potentially
useful
for
the
comparison
it
affords
between
observed
performance
and
that
of
an
intuitively
attractive
ideal
search
procedure
.
As
a
practical
application
of
such
a
model
this
paper
considers
the
design
of
a
novel
tree
search
scheme
based
on
a
bit
vector
representation
of
data
and
shows
that
essentially
the
same
algorithm
can
be
used
to
design
either
an
ideal
search
tree
or
a
bit
-
vector
tree
.
An
experimental
study
of
a
small

illustrates
the
concepts

affect

organization
performance
,
an
elusive

,
and
then
presents
a
methodology

a

and
a
programmed
system
to
estimate
primarily
total
storage
costs
and
average
access
time
of
several
file
organizations
,
given
a
specific
data
base
,
query
characterization
and
device
-
related
specifications
.
Based
on
these
estimates
,
an
appropriate
file
structure
may
be
selected
for
the
specific
situation
.
The
system
is
a
convenient
tool
to
study
file
structures
and
to
facilitate
as
much
as
possible
the
process
of
data
base

design
and

.W
Using
ideas
from
information
theory
,
this
paper
develops
a
heuristic
algorithm
that
converts
a
limited
entry
decision
table
to
a
tree
structured
computer
program
with
near
minimum
average
processing
time
.
The
method
is
applicable
to
any
limited
entry
decision
table
and
does
not
require
that
actions
have
single
rules
or
that
the
cost
of
testing
conditions
be
equal
.
It
is
thus
more
general
than
the
previously
published
heuristic
algorithms
.
Compared
to
the
optimal
algorithm
of
Reinwald
and
Soland
,
this
algorithm
is
easy
to
code
and
takes
a
much
smaller
translation
time
;
it
is
thus
felt
that
it
is
more
useful
in
practice
.
The
algorithm
is
well
suited
for
manual
conversion
of
decision
tables
to
flowcharts
.

.W
A
generalization
of
AVL
trees
is
proposed
in
which
imbalances
up
to
(
triangle
shape
)
is
a
small
integer
.
An
experiment
is
performed
to
compare
these
trees
with
standard
AVL
trees
and
with
balanced
trees
on
the
basis
of
mean
retrieval
time
,
of
amount
of
restructuring
expected
,
and
on
the
worst
case
of
retrieval
time
.
It
is
shown
that
,
by
permitting
imbalances
of
up
to
five
units
,
the
retrieval
time
is
increased
a
small
amount
while
the
amount
of
restructuring
required
is
decreased
by
a
factor
of
ten
.
A
few
theoretical
results
are
derived
,
including
the
correction
of
an
earlier
paper
,
and
are
duly
compared
with
the
experimental
data
.
Reasonably
good
correspondence
is
found

.W
A
formal
system
is
presented
which
abstracts
the
notions
of
data
item
,
function
,
and
relation
.
It
is
argued
that
the
system
is
more
suitable
than
set
theory
(
or
its
derivatives
)
for
the
concise
and
accurate
description
of
program
semantics
.
It
is
shown
how
the
system
can
be
used
to
build
composite
data
types
out
of
simper
ones
with
the
operations
of
rowing
,
structuring
,
and
uniting
.
It
is
also
demonstrated
that
completely
new
primitive
types
can
be
introduced
into
languages
through
the
mechanism
of
singleton
data
types
.
Both
deterministic
and
nondeterministic
functions
are
shown
to
be
definable
in
the
system
.
It
is
described
how
the
local
environment
can
be
modeled
as
a
data
item
and
how
imperative
statements
can
be
considered
functions
on
the
environment
.
The
nature
of
recursive
functions
is
briefly
discussed
,
and
a
technique
is
presented
by
which
they
can
be
introduced
into
the
system
.
The
technique
is
contrasted
with
the
use
of
the
paradoxical
combinator
,
Y
.
The
questions
of
local
and
global
environments
and
of
various
modes
of
function
calling
and
parameter
passing
are
touched
upon
.
The
theory
is
applied
to
the
proof
of
several
elementary
theorems
concerning
the
semantics
of
the
assignment
,
conditional
,
and
iterative
statements
.

in

A
learning
program
has
been
written
is
BASIC
to
play
four
-
player

dominoes
.
Because
dominoes
is
a
game
of
incomplete
information
,
the
program
uses
somewhat
different
principles
of
artificial
intelligence
from
those
used
in
programs
for
games
of
complete
information
,
such
as
checkers
,
chess
,
and
go
.
The
program
was
constructed
to
use
a
"
strategy
signature
table
"
which
classifies
board
situations
through
the
interactions
of
game
parameters
.
Each
entry
in
the
table
contains
adaptively
determined
weights
indicating
the
advi
sability
of
various
strategies
.
Once
chosen
,
a
strategy
then
employs
probability
analysis
and
linear
polynomial
evaluation
to
choose
a
move
.
Our
program
wins
approximately
two

thirds
of

An
addendum
to
the
Report
of
the
ACM
Curriculum
Committee
on
Computer
Education
for
Management
is
proposed
.
The
proposed
addendum
is
to
include
in
the
curriculum
a
course
on
Information
Systems
administration
.
It
is
important
for
two
reasons
:
(
1
)
the
systems
designer
must
understand
the
administrative
framework
in
which
he
must
operate
to
work
effectively
,
and
(
2
)
an
important
objective
of
the
curriculum
recommendations
is
to
prepare
the
future
manager
of
the
computer
activity
.
It
is
felt
that
the
importance
of
these
two
reasons
justifies
the
addition
of
the
recommended
course
.
The
course
is
outlined
in
the
format
of
the
original
report

This
paper
presents
the
goals
and
organization
of
a
course
about
programming
designed
to
provide
entering
students
in
a
graduate
program
with
a
cultural
enrichment
in
their
professional
lives
.
The
students
are
expected
to
have
taken
at
least
two
programming
courses
prior
to
this
one
and
,
therefore
,
to
be
familiar
with
at
least
two
programming
languages
,
both
as
students
and
users
.
Teaching
someone
how
to
program
is
similar
to
teaching
him
to
play
a
musical
instrument
:
neither
skill
can
be
taught
-
they
must
be
learned
.
However
,
the
teacher
still
serves
several
vital
purposes
:
to
present
a
set
of
rules
for
producing
well
-
formed
utterances
;
to
offer
numerous
demonstrations
of
his
own
skill
;
and
to
function
as
an
involved
critic
.
Finally
,
the
teacher
is
the
source
of
information
about
the
process
in
which
the
student
is
involved
.

A
Note
on
Information
Organization
and
Storage
A+Note
Information+Organization
.W
Since
the
logical
structure
of
a
data
base
can
be
represented
by
a
tree
or
graph
,
it
is
quite
natural
for
us
to
view
the
process
of
designing
a
data
base
as
that
of
constructing
a
tree
or
a
graph
.
A
general
method
for
constructing
such
a
tree
or
a
graph
is
provided
.
There
are
three
important
elements
in
this
general
construction
method
;
namely
,
a
set
of
binary
relations
,
an
algorithm
for
constructing
subsets
of
a
set
,
and
an
algorithm
for
selecting
an
element
from
the
given
set
of
objects
.
The
use
of
different
relations
and
algorithms
results
in
different
information
structures
,
as
list
,
tree
,
ring
,
etc
.
Thus
the
problem
of
information
organization
and
storage
is
reduced
to
that
of
defining
relations
and
formulating
algorithms
under
a
given
set
of
constraints
.
The
results
presented
may
be
valuable
to
designers
as
useful
design
concepts
,
and
may
serve
as
a
basis
for
developing
a
formal
theory
on
the
subject

method
of
synchronizing
processors
in
a
multiprocessor
system
usually
require
uninterruptable

An

scheme
called

has
been
developed
for
a
dual
DEC
PDP
-
10
system
with
real

.
The
read
-
interlock

does
require
a

instruction
in
the
repertoire
of
the
processors
and
a
special
"

in
the
repertoire
of

.
When
a
processor
examines
a
"

"
(
a
memory
location
)
with
a
read
-
interlock
instruction
,
it
will
be

examining
a

immediately
sets
it
if
it
was

(
this
event

.
Writing
into
a

clears
it
.
Having

of

is

Efficient

Efficient+Multiprogramming
Multiprogramming+Resource

.W
Although
sometimes
thought
of
as
only
a
component
of
time
-
sharing
operation
,
multiprogramming
can
involve
broader
questions
of
resource
allocation
,
since
fairness
is
not
required
to
meet
a
response
criterion
.
In
a
multiprogrammed
system
,
it
may
serve
maximal
resource
use
to
be
unfair
,
for
example
by
holding
an
input
/
output
channel
idle
for
a
program
while
it
completes
a
small
amount
of
processor
usage
,
enabling
further
use
of
the
channel
.
Several
applications
of
this
principle
are
given
,
and
it
is
suggested
that
a
multiprogramming
executive
might
dynamically
adjust
its
allocation
algorithms
to
gain
efficiency
.
Allocation
of
resources
is
closely
connected
to
accounting
for
those
resources
,
raising
the
problems
of
repeatability
,
minimal
uncharged
overhead
,
and
relative
weighting
of
charges
for
dependent
resources
.
Since
weightings
may
depend
on
allocation
algorithms
,
these
are
not
arbitrary
accounting
parameters
.
Often
the
only
repeatable
accounting
is
one
which
omits
an
extensive
overhead
will
be
paid
,
and
should
multiprogramming
prove
efficient
,
overcharges
will
result
.
Multiprogramming
turns
on
allocation
of
the
memory
resource
essential
to
control
of
other
resources
.
The
general
suggestions
for
allocation
and
accounting
are
applied
to
this
question
,
and

details
provided

the

A+Practical

.W
Resource
scheduling
and
allocation
can
be
expensive
with
regard
to
time
and
space
in
multiprogramming
or
time
-
sharing
environments
involving
large
numbers
of
tasks
and
resources
with
conflicting
requirements
.
Detection
and
/
or
prevention
of
deadlocks
can
require
massive
amounts
of
additional
overhead
if
efficient
usage
of
resources
is
to
be
maintained
.
A
resource
management
program
is
described
which
uses
linked
lists
along
with
other
techniques
to
overcome
a
large
portion
of
this
overhead
.
The
program
,
which
is
currently
running
as
part
of
a
large
scale
general
purpose
operating
system
,
keeps
resources
relatively
active
but
does
not
detect
or
prevent
all
deadlocks
in
its
implemented
state
.
Certain
changes
,
which
would
permit
more
comprehensive
levels
of
deadlock
prevention
/
detection
at
additional
cost
,
have
not
been
incorporated
in
the

system
due
to
the

A
probabilistic
analysis
is
employed
to
determine
the
effect
of
hierarchical

organizations
on

retrieval
operations

The

storage
hardware
is
assumed
to
consist
on
n

levels
of
linearly
connected
memory
hardware
with
increasing
data
access
times

increasing

,
consist
of
fast

A
study
is
presented
of
some
of
the
system
implications
of
memory
hierarchies
in
which
the
backing
or
secondary
store
has
a
very
small

time
,
relative
of
both
the
time
required
for
writing
and
to
the
read
time
of
conventional
backing
storage
devices
.
Several
analytic
models
are
introduced
,
and
it
is
shown
that
such
hierarchies
may
operate
in
ways
which
differ
from
those
of
more
conventional
hierarchies
.
In
particular
,
it
is
shown
that
it
may
not
be
necessary
to
multiprogram
in
such
a
situation
.
In
the
past
,
backing
storage
devices
have
been
roughly
symmetric
with
respect
to
their
read
and

times

This

Design
and
Implementation
of
a
Diagnostic
Compiler
for
PL
/
I
Diagnostic+Compiler
.W
PL
/
C
is
a
compiler
for
a
dialect
for
PL
/
I
.
The
design
objective
was
to
provide
a
maximum
degree
of
diagnostic
assistance
in
a
batch
processing
environment
.
For
the
most
part
this
assistance
is
implicit
and
is
provided
automatically
by
the
compiler
.
The
most
remarkable
characteristic
of
PL
/
C
is
its
perseverance
-
it
completes
translation
of
every
program
submitted
and
continues
execution
until
a
user
-
established
error
limit
is
reached
.
This
requires
that
the
compiler
repair
errors
encountered
during
both
translation
and
execution
,
and
the
design
of
PL
/
C
is
dominated
by
this
consideration
.
PL
/
C
also
introduces
several
explicit
user
-
controlled
facilities
for
program
testing
.
To
accommodate
these
extensions
to
PL
/
I
without
abandoning
compatibility
with
IBM
compiler
PL
/
C
permits
"
pseudo
comments
"
-
constructions
whose
contents
can
optionally
be
considered
either
source
test
or
comment
.
In
spite
of
the
diagnostic
effort
PL
/
C
is
a
fast
and
efficient
processor
.
It
effectively
demonstrates
that
compilers
can
provide
better
diagnostic
assistance
than
is
customarily
offered
,
even
when
a
sophisticated
source
language
is
employed
,
and
that
this
assistance
need

The

The+Effects

.W
A
study
is
made
of
the
way
in
which
asynchronous
time
division
multiplexing
changes
the
stochastic
nature
of
the
arrival
process
from
a
user
to
the
computer
and
,
consequently
,
affects
the
performance
of
a
time
-
shared
computer
-
communications
system
.
It
is
concluded
that
while
,
for
certain
values
of
system
parameters
,
there
is
noticeable
improvement
in
the
performance
of
the
computer
(
model
)
,
in
the
sense
that
time
-
shared
scheduling
delays
are
reduced
,
these
improvements
are
offset
by
the
transmission
delays
imposed
by
multiplexing
so
that
there
may
be
little
or
no
change
in
the
computer
-
communications
system
performance
.
Analytical
and
simulation
results
are
based
on
the
model
of
the
computer
-
communications
system
being
an
M

queue
(

)
in

with

.W
A
method
for
saving
storage
space
for
text
strings
,
such
as
compiler
diagnostic
messages
,
is
described
.
The
method
relies
on
hand
selection
of
a
set
of
text
strings
which
are
common
to
one
or
more
messages
.
These
phrases
are
then
stored
only
once
.
The
storage
technique
gives
rise
to
a
mathematical
optimization
problem
:
determine
how
each
message
should
use
the
available
phrases
to
minimize
its
storage
requirement
.
This
problem
is
nontrivial
when
phrases
which
overlap
exist
.
However
,
a
dynamic
programming
algorithm
is
presented
which
solves
the
problem
in

which
grows
linearly
with
the

of

This
paper
explores
the
advantages
of
the
concurrent
design
of
the
language
,
operating
system
,
and
machine
(
via
microcode
)
to
create
an
interactive
programming
laboratory
.
It
describes
the
synergistic
effect
that
the
freedom
to
move
and
alter
features
from
one
of
these
domains
to
another
has
had
on
the
design
of
this
system
(
which
has
not
been
implemented
)
.
This
freedom
simplified
both
incremental
compilation
and
the
system
's
addressing
structure
,
and
centralized
the
communication
mechanisms
enabling
the
construction
of
hierarchical
subsystems
.
It
also
suggested
an
important
new
concept
for
operating
systems
:
separation
of
the
scheduling
from
the
maintenance
functions
in
resource
allocation
.
This
separation
enables
incorporation
of
new
scheduling
algorithms
(
decision
of
what
to
do
)
without
endangering
the
system
integration
(
correctly

A
critical
failure
of
current
software
system
design
and
implementation
methodology
is
that
the
performance
of
a
proposed
design
is
not
evaluated
before
it
is
actually
implemented
.
In
this
paper
the
reasons
for
this
failure
are
explored
,
and
a
new
methodology
which
overcomes
many
of
the
difficulties
is
proposed
.
A
system
which
integrates
performance
evaluation
with
design
and
implementation
is
described
.
This
system
is
based
on
a
simple

high

language
which
is
used
to
describe
the

system
at

The

is
used
as
direct

to

Using
the

information
obtained
from
these

as
feedback
,
the
problems
which
adversely
affect
performance
are
detected
early
enough
so
that
they
can
be
corrected

costly

Both

.W
An
algorithm
is
described
for
reducing
the
generalized
eigenvalue
problem
Ax
=
lambda
Bx
to
an
ordinary
problem
,
in
case
A
and
B
are
symmetric
band
matrices
with
B
positive
definite
.
If
n
is
the
order
of
the
matrix
and
m
the
bandwidth
,
the
matrices
A
and
B
are
partitioned
into
m
-
by
-
m
blocks
;
and
the
algorithm
is
described
in
terms
of
these
blocks
.
The
algorithm
reduces
the
generalized
problem
to
an
ordinary
eigenvalue
problem
for
a
symmetric
band
matrix
C
whose
bandwidth
is
the
same
as
A
and
B
.
The
algorithm
is
similar
to
those
of
Rutishauser
and
Schwartz
for
the
reduction
of
symmetric
matrices
to
band
form
.
The
calculation
C
requires
order
mn
^

operation
.
The
round
-
off
error
in
the
calculation
of
C
is
of
the
same
order
as
the
sum
of
the
errors
at
each
of
the
n

of
the
algorithm
,
the
latter
errors
being

the

The

classically
titled
"

takes
various
forms
in
the
literature
.
Most
of
these
formulations
can
be
presented
in
the
terminology
of
classical
Network
Theory
.
One
such
formulation
is
:
Given
a
nondirected
network
,
partition
its
nodes
into
a
minimal
number
of
subsets
such
that
no
two
members
of
the
same
subset
are
connected
by
anarc
.
An
obvious
lower
limit
to
this
number
is
the
size
of
the
largest
strongly
connected
subgraph
.
Kirchgassner
proved
that
an
upper
limit
is
this
size
plus
one
.
One
logical
extension
of
the
previous
work
is
the
introduction
of

where
W
(

is
the

The
object
of
this

is
to
generalize
the
definition
of
largest
strongly

subgraph
to
include
the
weighting
of
nodes
,
to
present
an
approximate
algorithm
which
usually
finds
the

,
and
to
discuss
the
application
of
this
algorithm
to
the

When

a
,
is

generating

with

is
straightforward
.
There
is
no

method
for
generating

variates
with

parameters
.
A
common
procedure
is
to
approximately
generate
such
random
variables
by
use
of
the
so
-
called
probability
switch
method
.
Another
procedure
,
which
is

,
is
due
to
Johnk

This

presents
a
rejection
method
for
exactly
generating
gamma

when
a

.
The
efficiency
of
the
rejection
method
is
shown
to
be
better
than
the

of
Johnk
's

The
paper
concludes
that
when

the
following
mix
of
procedures
yields
the
best
combination
of
accuracy

Arguments

the
Construction

Utility
Community+Information

.W
In
this
article
the
author
urges
a
prudent
and
decentralized
approach
to
the
question
of
the
design
and
desirability
of
computerized
community
information
utilities
.
Before
accepting
the
inevitability
and
desirability
of
this
or
any
technology
,
we
should
:
(
1
)
be
sure
of
the
feasibility
(
internally
and
externally
)
of
what
is
proposed
;
(
2
)
project
and
perhaps
wait
for
changes
in
complementary
techniques
;
(
3
)
evaluate
current
and
projected
supplementary
techniques
;
(
4
)
establish
the
existence
of
demand
for
what
is
proposed
;
(
5
)
take
steps
to
involve
a
representative
group
of
ultimate
users
in
systems
design
,
and
(
6
)
carefully
think
through
possible
side
effects
on
man
and
his
world
view
.
Current
proposals
for
community
information
utilities
are
examined
in
this
framework
,
and
the
conclusion
is
drawn
that
society
is
not
yet
in
a
position
to
justify
either
the
construction
of
an
information
utility
in
a
prototype
community
or
the
acceptance
of
a
policy
in
favor
of
its
widespread
implementation
.

.W
A
method
is
described
for
composing
musical
rounds
by
computer
.
This
method
uses
some
music
theory
plus
additional
heuristics
.
Fundamental
to
the
method
is
a
set
of
productions
together
with
sets
of
applicability
rules
and
weight
rules
which
operate
on
the
productions
deciding
when
and
to
what
extent
they
are
available
for
use
.
Several
rounds
generated
by
the
computer
implementation
of
the
method
are
presented
.
Generally
,
the
resultant
music
sounds
mediocre
to
the
professional
although
usually
pleasing
to
the
layman
.
It
appears
that
full
-
blown
music
theory
is
not
needed
for
rounds
--
all
the
hardware
required
for
structural
levels
is
not
necessary
for
these
pieces
.

Improving

Critical
Working
Sets
Improving+Locality
Critical+Working
Working+Sets
.W
A
new
approach
to
program
locality
improvement
via
restructuring
is
described
.
The
method
is
particularly
suited
to
those
systems
where
primary
memory
is
managed
according
to
a
working
set
strategy
.
It
is
based
on
the
concept
of
critical
working
set
,
a
working
set
which
does
not
contain
the
next
memory
reference
.
The
data
the
method
operates
upon
are
extracted
from
a
trace
of
the
program
to
be
restructured
.
It
is
shown
that
,
except
in
some
special
cases
,
the
method
is
not
optimum
.
However
,
the
experimental
results
obtained
by
using
the
method
to
restructure
an
interactive
text
editor
and
the
file
system
module
of
an
operating
system
have
shown
its
substantial
superiority
over
the
other
methods
proposed

literature

the

Large

be
generating

without
ever
having
been
"

"
by
test

with

The
reason
for
this
failure
to
adequately
test
the

is
that
rarely
are
there
large
problems
with
known

readily
available
.

a

justification

an
illustrative

of
a

The

Programming
systems
which
permit
arbitrary
linked
list
structures
enable
the
user
to
create
complicated
structures
without
sufficient
protection
.
Deletions
can
result
in
unreachable
data
elements
,
and
there
is
no
guarantee
that
additions
will
be
performed
properly
.
To
remedy
this
situation
,
this

proposes
a
gauge
which
provides
for
the
creation
of
a
restricted
class
of
data
structures
but
ensures
the
correctness
of
the
program
.
This
is
accomplished
by
an
explicit

facility

a

.W
An
extension
of
the
buddy
method
,
called
the
weighted
buddy
method
,
for
dynamic
storage
allocation
is
presented
.
The
weighted
buddy
method
allows
block
sizes
of
2
^
k
and
3
(
2
^

)
,
whereas
the
original
buddy
method
allowed
only
block
sizes
of
2
^
k
.
This
extension
is
achieved
at
an
additional
cost
of
only
two
bits
per
block
.
Simulation
results
are
presented
which
compare
this
method
with
the
buddy
method
.
These
results
indicate
that
for
a
uniform
request
distribution
,
the
buddy
system
has
less
total
memory
fragmentation
than
the
weighted
buddy

.
However
,
the
total

is
smaller
for
the

when
the

are
for
exponentially

.W
This
paper
modifies
an
earlier
algorithm
for
converting
decision
tables
into
flowcharts
which
minimize
subsequent
execution
time
when
compiled
into
a
computer
program
.
The
algorithms
considered
in
this
paper
perform
limited
search
and
,
accordingly
,
do
not
necessarily
result
in
globally
optimal
solutions
.
However
,
the
greater
search
effort
needed
to
obtain
a
globally
optimal
solution
for
complex
decision
tables
is
usually
not
justified
by
sufficient
savings
in
execution
time
.
There
is
an
analogy
between
the
problem
of
converting
decision
tables
into
efficient
flowcharts
and
the
well
-
understood
problem
in
information
theory
of
noiseless
coding
.
The
results
of
the
noiseless
coding
literature
are
used
to
explore
the
limitations
of
algorithms
used
to
solve
the
decision
table
problem
.
The
analogy
between
the
two
problems
is
also
used
to
develop
improvements
to
the
information
algorithm
in
extending
the
depth
of
search
under
certain
conditions
and
in
proposing
additional
conditions
to
be
added
to
the
decision
table
.
Finally
,
the
information
algorithm
is
compared
with
an
algorithm
proposed
in
a
recent

is
presented
for
the

Several

are
established
between

and

These

place
additional

The

correspond
to
the

Using

Although
encipherment
has
often
been
discussed
as
a
means
to
protect
computer
data
,
its
costs
are
not
well
established
.
Five
experiments
were
conducted
to
measure
the
cpu
time
on
a
CDC
6400
required
by
additive
ciphers
programmed
both
in
assembly
language
and
in
Fortran
:
a
"
null
transformation
"
to
measure
the
time
to
move
data
without
encipherment
;
encipherment
with
one
-
word
key
;
encipherment
with
a
125
-
word
key
;
double
key

;
and
encipherment
using
a
pseudo
random
key
.
The
results
were
analyzed
for
consistency
over
100
runs
,
and
the
effects
of
constant
and
intermittent
errors
were
considered
.
Timing
rates
for
assembly
language
encipherment
ranged
from
498,800
characters
per
second
for
a
pseudo
random
key
cipher
to
2,092,000
characters
per
second
for
a
constant
one
-
word
key
cipher
.
The
latter
is
almost
equivalent
to
the
rate
required
simply
to
move
data
without
encipherment
.
Fortran
tests
required
over
four
times
as
much
cpu
time
.
This

introduces
the
idea
on

the

.W
In
many
computer
operating
systems
a
user
authenticates
himself
by
entering
a
secret
password
known
solely
to
himself
and
the
system
.
The
system
compares
this
password
with
one
recorded
in
a
Password
Table
which
is
available
to
only
the
authentication
program
.
The
integrity
of
the
system
depends
on
keeping
the
table
secret
.
In
this
paper
a
password
scheme
is
presented
which
does
not
require
secrecy
in
the
computer
.
All
aspects
of
the
system
,
including
all
relevant
code
and
data
bases
,
may
be
known
by
anyone
attempting
to
intrude
.
The
scheme
is
based
on
using
a
function
H
which
the
would
-
be
intruder
is
unable
to
invert
.
This
function
is
applied
to
the
user
's
password
and
the
result
compared
to
a
table
entry
,
a
match
being
interpreted
as
authentication
of
the
user
.
The
intruder
may
know
all
about
H
and
have
access
to
the
table
,
but
he
can
penetrate
the
system
only
if
he
can
invert
H
to
determine
an
input
that
produces
a
given
output
.
This
paper
discusses
issues
surrounding
selection
of
a
suitable
H
.
Two
different
plausible
arguments
are
given
that
penetration
would
be
exceedingly
difficult
,
and
it
is
then
argued
that
more
rigorous
results
are
unlikely
.
Finally
,
some
human
engineering
problems
relating
to
the
scheme
are
discussed

The

produced
a
need
for

by
a
factor
of
from

The
techniques
involve
special

and
the
encoding
of

Capability

Based

Based+Addressing
.W
Various
addressing
schemes
making
use
of
segment
tables
are
examined
.
The
inadequacies
of
these
schemes
when
dealing
with
shared
addresses
are
explained
.
These
inadequacies
are
traced
to
the
lack
of
an
efficient
absolute
address
for
objects
in
these
systems
.
The
direct
use
of
a
capability
as
an
address
is
shown
to
overcome
these
difficulties
because
it
provides
the
needed
absolute
address
.
Implementation
of
capability
-
based
addressing
is
discussed
.
It
is
predicted
that
the
use
of
tags
to
identify
capabilities
will
dominate
.
A
hardware
address
translation
scheme
which
never
requires
the
modification
of
the
representation
of
capabilities
is
suggested
.
The
scheme
uses
a
main
memory
hash
table
for
obtaining
a
segment
's
location
in
main
memory
given
its
unique
code
.
The
hash
table
is
avoided
for
recently
accessed
segments
by
means
of
a
set
of
associative
registers
.
A
computer
using
capability

may
be
substantially
superior
to

the
basis

.W
Using
direct
access
computer
files
of
bibliographic
information
,
an
attempt
is
made
to
overcome
one
of
the
problems
often
associated
with
information
retrieval
,
namely
,
the
maintenance
and
use
of
large
dictionaries
,
the
greater
part
of
which
is
used
only
infrequently
.
A
novel
method
is
presented
,
which
maps
the
hyperbolic
frequency
distribution
.
This
is
more
suited
to
implementation
on
storage
devices
.
This
method
treats
text
as
a
string
of
characters
rather
than
words
bounded
by
spaces
,
and
chooses
subsets
of
strings
such
that
their
frequencies
of
occurrence
are
more
even
than
those
of
word
types
.
The
members
of
this
subset
are
then
used
as
index
keys
for
retrieval
.
The
rectangular
distribution
of
key
frequencies
results
in
a
much
simplified
file
organization
and
promises
considerable
cost
advantages
.

the

system
for
C
.
mmp
,
the
Carnegie

.
This
philosophy
is
realized
through
the
introduction
of
a
generalized
notion
of
"
resource
"
,
both
physical
and
virtual
,
called
an
"
object
"
.
Mechanisms
are
presented
for
dealing
with
objects
,
including
the
creation
of
new
types
,
specification
of
new
operations
applicable
to
a
given
type
,
sharing
,
and
protection
of
any
reference
to
a
given
object
against
improper
application
of
any
of
the
operations
defined
with
respect
to
that
type
of
object
.
The
mechanisms
provide
a
coherent
basis
for
extension
of
the
system
in
two
directions
:
the
introduction
of
new
facilities
,
and
the
creation
of
highly

Two

Program+Efficiency
.W
Two
languages
enabling
their
users
to
estimate
the
efficiency
of
computer
programs
are
presented
.
The
program
whose
efficiency
one
wishes
to
estimate
is
written
in
the
first
language
,
a
go
-
to
-
less
programming
language
which
includes
most
of
the
features
of
Algol
60
.
The
second
language
consists
of
interactive
commands
enabling
its
users
to
provide
additional
information
about
the
program
written
in
the
first
language
and
to
output
results
estimating
its
efficiency
.
Processors
for
the
two
languages
are
also
described
.
The
first
processor
is
a
syntax
-
directed
translator
which
compiles
a
program
into
a
symbolic
formula
representing
the
execution
time
for
that
program
.
The
sound
processor
is
a
set
of
procedures
for
that
program
.
The
second
processor
is
a
set
of
procedures
for
algebraic
manipulation
which
can
be
called
by
the
user
to
operate
on
the
formula
produced
by
the
first
processor
.
Examples
of
the
usage
of
the
two
languages
are
included
.
The
limitations
of
the
present
system

to
Knuth

This

algorithms

masking

rotational

the
anticipatory

a
mono

system

A
basic
permutation
algorithm
and
several
variations
are
given

Because
of
the
anticipatory
nature
of
the

scheduling
,
these
algorithms
are
restricted

While

numerical
computations
,
matrix

methods
are
typical

It
is
shown
that
latency
may
be
masked
using
a

Programming

power
of
a

on
the

cost
of
an
algorithm
expressed
in
that

:
when
features
not
actually
used
by
the
algorithm
are
removed
from
the

,
the
cost
of
compiling
the

decreases
moderately

when

needed
are

,
the

The
spline
under
tension
was
introduced
by
Schweikert
in
an
attempt
to
imitate
cubic
splines
but
avoid
the
spurious
critical
points
they
induce
.
The
defining
equations
are
presented
here
,
together
with
an
efficient
method
for
determining
the
necessary
parameters
and
computing
the
resultant
spline
.
The
standard
scalar
-

curve
fitting
problem
is
discussed
,
as
well
as
the
fitting
of
open
and
closed
curves
in
the
plane
.
The
use
of
these
curves
and
the
importance
of
the
tension
in
the
fitting
of
contour
lines
are
mentioned
as
application
.

An

synthesizing

based
on
the

given

In

translated

a

For

the

and
a

is
obtained
as

This

achieved
by
using
a

.
The

Predicting
the
performance
of
a
proposed
automatically
managed
multilevel
memory
system
requires
a
model
of
the
patterns
by
which
programs
refer
to
the
information
stored
in
the
memory
.
Some
recent
experimental
measurements
on
the
Multics
virtual
memory
suggest
that
,
for
rough
approximations
,
a
remarkably
simple
program
reference
model
will
suffice
.
The
simple
model
combines
the
effect
of
the
information
reference
pattern
with
the
effect
of
the
automatic
management
algorithm
to
produce
a
single
,
composite
statement
:
the
mean
number
of
memory
references
between
paging
exceptions
increases
linearly
with
the
size
of
the
paging
memory
.
The
resulting
model
is
easy
to
manipulate
,
and
is
applicable
to
such
diverse
problems
as
choosing
an
optimum
size
for
a
paging
memory
,
arranging
for
reproducible
memory
usage
charges
,
and
estimating
the
amount
of

When
the
amount
of
space
required
for
file
storage
exceeds
the
amount
which
can
be
kept
on

line
,
decisions
must
be
made
as
to
which
files
are
to
be
permanently
resident
and
which
mountable
.
These
decisions
will
affect
the
number
of
mount
requests
issued
to
the
operators
.
This
is
often
a
bottleneck
in

reducing

thus
decreases
turnaround

On

Representative+Synthetic
Synthetic+Workload
.W
A
general
method
of
constructing
a
drive
workload
representative
of
a
real
workload
is
described
.
The
real
workload
is
characterized
by
its
demands
on
the
various
system
resources
.
These
characteristics
of
the
real
workload
are
obtained
from
the
system
accounting
data
.
The
characteristics
of
the
drive
workload
are
determined
by
matching
the
joint
probability
density
of
the
real
workload
with
that
of
the
drive
workload
.
The
drive
workload
is
realized
by
using
a
synthetic
program
in
which
the
characteristics
can
be
varied
by
varying
the
appropriate
parameters
.
Calibration
experiments
are
conducted
to
determine
expressions
relating
the
synthetic
program
parameters
with
the
workload
characteristics
.
The
general
method

the

Current

The
high

a
need
for
more
careful

organization
in
a
paged

than
is
typical
of
most

similar

This
article
analyses
that
cost
and
proposes
a
method
called
multiple

hashing
which
attempts
to
minimize
it
.
Since
this
approach
is
not
always
preferable
to

The

Reentrant
Polygon
Clipping
Reentrant+Polygon
Polygon+Clipping
.W
A
new
family
of
clipping
algorithms
is
described
.
These
algorithms
are
able
to
clip
polygons
against
irregular
convex
plane
-
faced
volumes
in
three
dimensions
,
removing
the
parts
of
the
polygon
which
lie
outside
the
volume
.
In
two
dimensions
the
algorithms
permit
clipping
against
irregular
convex
windows
.
Polygons
to
be
clipped
are
represented
as
an
ordered
sequence
of
vertices
without
repetition
of
first
and
last
,
in
marked
contrast
to
representation
as
a
collection
of
edges
as
was
heretofore
the
common
procedure
.
Output
polygons
have
an
identical
format
,
with
new
vertices
introduced
in
sequence
to
describe
any
newly
-
cut
edge
or
edges
.
The
algorithms
easily
handle
the
particularly
difficult
problem
of
detecting
that
a
new
vertex
may
be
required
at
a
corner
of
the
clipping
window
.
The
algorithms
described
achieve
considerable
simplicity
by
clipping
separately
against
each
clipping
plane
or
window
boundary
.
Code
capable
of
clipping
the
polygon
against
a
single
boundary
is
reentered
to
clip
against
subsequent
boundaries
.
Each
such
reentrant
stage
of
clipping
need
store
only
two
vertex
values
and
may
begin
its
processing
as
soon
as
the
first
output
vertex
from
the
proceeding
stage
is
ready
.
Because
the
same
code
is
reentered
for
clipping
against
subsequent
boundaries
,
clipping
against
very
complex
window
shapes
is
practical
.
For
perspective
applications
in
three
dimentions
,
a
six
-
plane
truncated
pyramid
is
chosen
as
the
clipping
volume
.
The
two
additional
planes
parallel
to
the
projection
screen
serve
to
limit
the
range
of
depth
preserved
through
the
projection
.
A
perspective
projection
method
which
provides
for
arbitrary
view
angles
and
depth
of
field
in
spite
of
simple
fixed
clipping
planes
is
described
.
This
method
is
ideal
for
subsequent
hidden
-
surface
computations
.

Tridiagonalization
by
Permutations
.W
Tridiagonalizing
a
matrix
by
similarity
transformations
is
an
important
computational
tool
in
numerical
linear
algebra
.
Consider
the
class
of
sparse
matrices
which
can
be
tridiagonalized
using
only
row
and
corresponding
column
permutations
.
The
advantages
of
using
such
a
transformation
include
the
absence
of
round
-
off
errors
and
improved
computation
time
when
compared
with
standard
transformations
.
A
graph
theoretic
algorithm
which
examines
an
arbitrary
n
x
n
matrix
and
determines
whether
or
not
it
can
be
permuted
into
tridiagonal
form
is
given
.
The
algorithm
requires
no
arithmetic
while
the
number
of
comparisons
,
the
number
of
assignments
,
and
the
number
of
increments
are
linear
in
n
.
This
compares
very
favorably
with
standard
transformation
methods
.
If
the
matrix
is
permutable
into
tridiagonal
form
,
the
algorithm
gives
the
explicit
tridiagonal
form
.
Otherwise
,
early
rejection
will
occur
.

A

in

by
a

function
z
=

The

function
is
a

Emphasis
is
an
avoiding
excessive

The

an

.W
The
solution
of
linear
systems
having
real
,
symmetric
,
diagonally
dominant
,
tridiagonal
coefficient
matrices
with
constant
diagonals
is
considered
.
It
is
proved
that
the
diagonals
of
the
LU
decomposition
converges
when
floating
-
point
precision
.
It
is
also
proved
that
the
computed
LU
decomposition
converges
when
floating
-
point
arithmetic
is
used
and
that
the
limits
of
the
LU
diagonals
using
floating
point
are
roughly
within
machine
precision
of
the
limits
using
real
arithmetic
.
This
fact
is
exploited
to
reduce
the
number
of
floating
-
point
operations
required
to
solve
a
linear
system
from
8n

7
to
5n
+
2k
-
3
,
where
k
is
much
less
than
n
,
the
order
of
the
matrix
.
If
the
elements
of
the
subdiagonals
and
superdiagonals
are
1
,
then
only
4n
+
2k
-
3
operations
are
needed
.
The
entire
LU
decomposition
takes
k
words
of
storage
,
and
considerable
savings
in
array
subscripting
are
achieved
.
Upper
and
lower
bounds
on
k
are
obtained
in
terms
of
the
ratio
of
the
coefficient
matrix
diagonal
constants
and
parameters
of
the

A

for

on

is
presented
.
The
algorithm
is
shown
to
treat
a
very
general
class
of
function
spaces
.
For
a
graph
of
e
edges
,
the
algorithm
has
a
worst

time
bound
of
O
(

.
It
is
also
shown
that
in
programming
terms
,
the
number
of
operations
is
proportional
to
e
plus
the
number
of
exits
from

loops
.
Consequently

The
algorithm
can
be
extended
to
yet
larger

of

and

by
relaxing
the
time

are

can

On
the
Complexity
of
LR
(
k
)
Testing
.W
The
problem
of
determining
whether
an
arbitrary
context
-
free
grammar
is
a
member
of
some
easily
parsed
subclass
of
grammars
such
as
the
LR
(
k
)
grammars
is
considered
.
The
time
complexity
of
this
problem
is
analyzed
both
when
k
is
considered
to
be
a
fixed
integer
and
when
k
is
considered
to
be
a
parameter
of
the
test
.
In
the
first
case
,
it
is
shown
that
for
every
k
there
exists
an
O
(
n
(
k
+
2
)
)
algorithm
for
testing
the
LR
(
k
)
property
,
where
n
is
the
size
of
the
grammar
in
question
.
On
the
other
hand
,
if
both
k
and
the
subject
grammar
are
problem
parameters
,
then
the
complexity
of
the
problem
depends
very
strongly
on
the
representation
chosen
for
k
.
More
specifically
,
it
is
shown
that
this
problem
is
NP
-
complete
when
k
is
expressed
in
unary
.
When
k
is
expressed
in
binary
the
problem
is
complete
for
nondeterministic
exponential
time
.
These
results
carry
over
to
many
other
parameterized
classes
of
grammars
,
such
as
the

Attribute

are
an

devised
by
Knuth
as
a

for
including
the
semantics
of
a

-

language
with
the
syntax
of
the
language
.
The
circularity

for

to
determine
whether
the
semantics
for
all

in

It
is
proved
that
this

.
Specifically
,
it
is
shown
that
any
deterministic

which
solves
the
problem
must
for
infinitely
many

use
an
exponential

The
purpose
of
this
paper
is
twofold
.
First
,
a
brief
exposition
of
the
general
backtrack
technique
and
its
history
is
given
.
Second
,
it
is
shown
how
the
use
of
macros
can
considerably
shorten
the
computation
time
in
many
cases
.
In
particular
,
this
technique
has
allowed
the
solution
of
two
previously
open
combinatorial
problems
,
the
computation
of
new
terms
in
a
well
-
known
series
,
and
the
substantial
reduction
in
computation
time
for
the
solution
to
another
combinatorial
problem
.

The
issue
of

has
had
a
history
of
heated
controversy
.
To
put
this
issue
on
a
solid
footing
,
this
paper
reviews
numerous
theoretical
results
on
control
structures
and
explores
their
practical
implications
.
The
classic
result
of
Bohm
and
Jacopini
on
the
theoretical
completeness
of
if
-
then
-
else
and
while
-
do
is
discussed
.
Several
recent
ideas
on

structures
are
then
explored
.
These
include
a
review
of
various
other
control
structures
,
results
on

limitations
,
and
theorems
relating
the
relative
power
of
control
structures
under
notions
of

.
In
conclusion
,
the
impact
of
theoretical
results
on
the
practicing
programmer
and
the
importance
of
one
-

are
discussed
.
It
is
argued
further
that
there
is
insufficient

An
approach
for
implementing
a
"

interface
to
support
a

is
proposed
.
The
basic
idea
is
to
employ
automatic
programming
techniques
so
that
the
interface
analyzes
and
efficiently
refines
the
high
level
query
specification
supplied
by
the
user
.
A
relational
algebra
interface
,
called
SQUIRAL
,
which
was
designed
using
this
approach
,
is
described
in
detail
.
SQUIRAL
seeks
to
minimize
query
response
time
and
space
utilization
by
:
(

)
performing
global
query
optimization
,
(

exploiting

pipelined
concurrency
,
(

This
paper
deals
with
the
development
of
a
mathematical
model
for
and
the
digital
simulation
in
Fortran
IV
of
phytoplankton
and
zooplankton
population
densities
in
a
river
using
previously
developed
rate
expressions
.
In
order
to
study
the
relationships
between
the
ecological
mechanisms
involved
,
the
simulation
parameters
were
varied
illustrating
the
response
of
the
ecosystem
to
different
conditions
,
including
those
corresponding
to
certain
types
of
chemical
and
thermal
pollution
.
As
an
investigation
of
the
accuracy
of
the
simulation
methods
,
a
simulation
of
the
actual
population
dynamics
of
Asterionella
in
the
Columbia
River
was
made
based
on
approximations
of
conditions
in
that
river
.
Although
not
totally
accurate
,
the
simulation
was
found
to
predict
the
general
annual
pattern
of
plankton
growth
fairly
well
and
,
specifically
,
revealed
the
importance
of
the
annual
velocity
cycle
in
determining
such
patterns
.
In
addition
,
the
study
demonstrates
the
usefulness
of
digital
simulations
in
the
examinations
of
certain
aquatic
ecosystems
,
as
well
as
in
environmental
planning
involving
such

This
paper
develops
the
multidimensional
binary
search
tree
(

,
where
k
is
the
dimensionality
of
the
search

)
as
a
data
structure
for
storage
of
information
to
be
retrieved
by
associative

.
The
k

is
defined
and
examples
are
given
.
It
is
shown
to
be
quite
in
its
storage
requirements
.
A
significant
advantage
of
this
structure
is
that
a
single

structure
can
handle
many
types
of
queries
very
efficiently
.
Various

and
for

[

These
performances

surpass
the

The

,
one
performing

and
the
other
performing

The

Complete

.W
The
techniques
for
minimizing
logic
circuits
are
applied
to
the
simplification
of
decision
tables
by
the
combining
of
decision
rules
.
This
method
is
logically
equivalent
to
the
Quien
-
McCluskey
method
for
finding
prime
implicants
.
If
some
of
the
decision
rules
implied
in
the
ELSE
Rule
occur
with
low
frequency
,
then
the
ELSE
Rule
can
be
used
to
further
simplify
the
decision
table
.
Several
objectives
merit
consideration
in
optimizing
a
decision
table
:
(
1
)
reducing
machine
execution
time
;
(
2
)
reducing

time
;
(
3
)
reducing

memory
;
(
4
)
reducing
the
number
of
decision
rules
.
(
This
often
improves
the
clarity
of
the
decision
table
to
a
human
reader
.
)
It
will
be
shown
that
objectives
(

and
(

can
be
furthered
with
the
above
methods
.
Objective
(
1
)
is
also
attained
if

Published
comparisons
of
the
external
fragmentation
produced
by
first
-
fit
and
best
-
fit
memory
allocation
have
not
been
consistent
.
Through
simulation
,
a
series
of
experiments
were
performed
in
order
to
obtain
better
data
on
the
relative
performance
of
first
-
fit
and
best
-
fit
and
a
better
understanding
of
the
reasons
underlying
observed
differences
.
The
time
-
memory
-
product
efficiencies
of
first
-
fit
and
best
-
fit
were
generally
within
1
to
3
percent
of
each
other
.
Except
for
small
populations
,
the
size
of
the
request
population
had
little
effect
on
allocation
efficiency
.
For
exponential
and
hyperexponential
distributions
of
requests
,
first
-
fit
outperformed
best
-
fit
;
but
for
normal
and
uniform
distributions
,
and
for
exponential
distributions
distorted
in
various
ways
,
best
-
fit
outperformed
first
-
fit
.
It
is
hypothesized
that
when
first
-
fit
outperforms
best
-
fit
,
it
does
so
because
first
-
fit
,
by
preferentially
allocating
toward
one
end
of
memory
,
encourages
large
blocks
to
grow
at
the
other
end
.
Sufficient
contiguous
space
is
thereby
more
likely
to
be
available
for
relatively
large
requests
.
Results
of
simulation
experiments
supported
this
hypothesis
and
showed
that
the
relative
performance
of
first
-
fit
and
best
-
fit
depends
on
the
frequency
of
request
.
When
the
coefficient
of
variation
of
the
request
distribution
is
greater
than
or
approximately
equal
to
unity
,
first
-
fit
outperformed
best

can
be
contained

The
method
is
of

problems
.
It
consists
of
first
determining
the

that
encloses
the
given
curve
and
then
selecting
the
rectangle
of
minimum

capable
of
containing
this

.
Three
theorems
are
introduced
to
show
that
one

of
the

rectangle
must
be
colinear
with
an

Over
the

a

of
systems
for
the
computer
analysis
of
natural

sentences
have
been
based
on

:
a
context
-
free
grammar
which
defines
a
set
of
parse

for
a

,
plus
a
group
of
restrictions
to
which
a
tree
must
conform
in
order
to
be
a

.
As
the

an

becomes
essential
for

The

algorithm
to
locate
all

The
algorithm
consists
of
constructing
a

pattern
matching
machine
from
the
keywords
and
then
using
the
pattern
matching
machine
to
process
the

Construction
of
the
pattern

The
number

This

compares
a

organization

method
,
with
an

one
,
called

method

using
as
examples
two

models
.
The
significant
event
method
is
found
to
be
more
efficient
than
the
clock
pulse
method
at
low
levels
of
system
interaction
and
less

at
high
levels

A

model
for
the
trade

of
the
two
methods
is
developed
.
The
model
aids
in
choosing
between
the
two
simulation
methods
for
a
particular
experiment
.
It
is
concluded
that
the
significant
event
method
can
be
of
value
in
the
simulation
of
some
systems
when
computational
efficiency
is
of
sufficient

Data
set
allocation
in
today
's
multilevel
storage
systems
is
usually
based
on
qualitative
,
ad
hoc
decisions
.
While
it
would
be
desirable
to
obtain
an
optimal
solution
to
this
allocation
problem
,
it
is
clear
that
the
number
of
parameters
involved
makes
it
intractable
to
straight
-
forward
solution
.
In
such
a
situation
,
we
must
find
a
set
of
assumptions
which
simplify
the
problem
greatly
,
but
which
still
provide
a
basis
for
considering
all
significant
cost
elements
.
This
paper
presents
such
a
first
,
quantitative
allocation
step
.
It
considers
many
of
the
significant
detailed
costs
of
system
utilization
,
data
storage
,
data
staging
,
and
data
migration
.
Although
many
avenues
of
further
improvement
are
available
,
the
present
algorithm
seems
to
be
usefully
accurate
.
As
such
,
it
can
aid
in
quantifying
the
problems
of

,
and

on
the

technique
used
to
paint
the

on

The
shading
algorithm
itself
depends
in
part
on
the
method
for
modeling
the
object
,
which
also
determines
the
hidden
surface
algorithm
.
The
various
methods
of
object
modeling
,
shading
,
and
hidden
surface
removal
are
thus
strongly
interconnected
.
Several
shading
techniques
corresponding
to
different
methods
of
object
modeling
and
the
related
hidden
surface
algorithms
are
presented
here
.
Human
visual

the

are
considered
in
the
development
of
a
shading

that
provides

The
Designer
Problem
Solver
(
DPS
)
demonstrates
that
the
computer
can
perform
simple
design
tasks
.
In
particular
,
it
designs
furniture
and
equipment
layouts
.
This
task
was
chosen
because
it
is
simple
,
well
defined
,
and
characteristic
of
many
design
tasks
in
architecture
,
engineering
,
urban
planning
,
and
natural
resource
management
.
These
space
planning
tasks
usually
involve
manipulating
two
-
dimensional
representations
of
objects
to
create
feasible
or
optimal
solutions
for
problems
involving
topological
and
metric
spatial
constraints
.
The
paper
describes
extensive
tests
performed
on
the
program
.
DPS
is
a
heuristic
problem
solver
with
a
planning
phase
prefixed
to
it
.
It
uses
the
planning
process
to
give
it
a
sense
of
direction
,
diagnostic
procedures
to
locate
difficulties
,
and
remedial
actions
to
recover
from
difficulties
.
It
uses
a
convex
polygon
representation
to
accurately
describe
the
objects
and
the
layout
.
This
representation
allows
topological
and
metric
constraints
to
be
tested
and
the
design
to
be
easily
updated
.
DPS
has
been
applied
to
50
problems
.
While
it
is
slow
and
limited
in
scope
,
the
ideas
behind
it
are
general
.
It
demonstrates
the
need
for
selectivity
in

the

has
the
advantage
that
operations
are

On

This
report
discusses
a
problem
first
introduced
by
Patil
,
who
has
claimed
that
the
cigarette
smoker
's
problem
cannot
be
solved
using
the
P
and
V
operations
introduced
by
Dijkstra
unless
conditional
statements
are
used
.
An
examination
of
Patil
's
proof
shows
that
he
has
established
this
claim
only
under
strong
restrictions
on
the
use
of
P
and
V
.
These
restrictions
eliminate
programming
techniques
used
by
Dijkstra
and
others
since
the
first
introduction
of
the
semaphore
concept
.
This
paper
contains
a
solution
to
the

.
It
also
discusses
the
need
for
the
generalized

suggested
by

A

Typesetting
Mathematics
A+System
Typesetting+Mathematics
.W
This
paper
describes
the
design
and
implementation
of
a
system
for
typesetting
mathematics
.
The
language
has
been
designed
to
be
easy
to
learn
and
to
use
by
people
(
for
example
,
secretaries
and
mathematical
typists
)
who
know
neither
mathematics
nor
typesetting
.
Experience
indicates
that
the
language
can
be
learned
in
an
hour
or
so
,
for
it
has
few
rules
and
fewer
exceptions
.
For
typical
expressions
,
the
size
and
font
changes
,
positioning
,
line
drawing
,
and
the
like
necessary
to
print
according
to
mathematical
conventions
are
all
done
automatically
.
For
example
,
the
input
sum
from
i
=
o
to
infinity
x
sub
i
=
pi
over
2
produces
(
formula
)
.
The
syntax
of
the
language
is
specified
by
a
small
context
-
free
grammar
;
a
compiler
-
compiler
is
used
to
make
a
compiler
that
translates
this
language
into
typesetting
commands
.
Output
maybe
produced
on
either
a
phototypesetter
or
on
a
terminal
with
forward
and
reverse
half
-
line
motions
.
The
system
interfaces
directly
with
text
formatting
programs
,
so
mixtures
of
text
and
mathematics
may
be
handled
simply
.

-

.
It
is
a

that
described
by

.
It
has
been
generalized
and
adapted
to
fit
into
the
complete

process
;
to
use
a
more
compact
data
representation
and
more
efficient

techniques
;
to
take
fuller
advantage
of
possible
available
previous
knowledge
about
the
matrix
.
And
it
is
designed
as
a

,
which
can
readily
be
coded
by
the
reader
in
the
high

The

New+Math
Computer+Programming
.W
Structured
programming
has
proved
to
be
an
important
methodology
for
systematic
program
design
and
development
.
Structured
programs
are
identified
as
compound
function
expressions
in
the
algebra
of
functions
.
The
algebraic
properties
of
these
function
expressions
permit
the
reformulation
(
expansion
as
well
as
reduction
)
of
a
nested
subexpression
independently
of
its
environment
,
thus
modeling
what
is
known
as
stepwise
program
refinement
as
well
as
program
execution
.
Finally
,
structured
programming
is
characterized
in
terms
of
the
selection
and
solution
of
certain
elementary
equations
defined
in
the
algebra
of
functions
.
These
solutions
can
be
given
in
general
formulas
,
each
involving
a
single
parameter
,
which
display
the
entire
freedom
available
in
creating
correct
structured
programs
.

in

the
absolute
error
in
the
solution
is
strictly
comparable
with
that

However
,
when

Professionalism

Field
Computing+Field
.W
The
term
professional
means
different
things
to
different
people
;
nevertheless
,
there
are
certain
general
technical
and
social
standards
normally
associated
with
a
professional
.
Further
,
the
term
is
more
generally
applied
to
the
practitioner
rather
than
to
the
researcher
.
But
within
the
rather
broad
definition
specified
,
the
computing
practitioner
is
,
as

,
not
regarded
as
a
professional

of
the
four

and
the

-
that
educate

the
practitioner

the
"

roles
of
these

various

In
most
database
organizations
,
the
cost
of
accessing
the
database
will
increase
due
to
structural
changes
caused
by
updates
and
insertions
.
By
reorganizing
the
database
,
the
access
costs
can
be
reduced
.
A
basic
problem
is
to
establish
the
proper
tradeoff
between
performance
,
storage
costs
,
and
reorganization
costs
.
This
paper
considers
the
optimum
points
at
which
to
reorganize
a

A

which
allows
for

is

A

describing

is
defined
,
and
this

is
minimized
to
obtain

The

.W
In
database
systems
,
users
access
shared
data
under
the
assumption
that
the
data
satisfies
certain
consistency
constraints
.
This
paper
defines
the
concepts
of
transaction
,
consistency
and
schedule
and
shows
that
consistency
requires
that
a
transaction
cannot
request
new
locks
after
releasing
a
lock
.
Then
it
is
argued
that
a
transaction
needs
to
lock
a
logical
rather
than
a
physical
subset
of
the
database
.
These
subsets
may
be
specified
by
predicates
.
An
implementation
of
predicate
locks
which
satisfies
the
consistency
condition
is
suggested
.

A
system
for
the

,
viewed

is
presented

The
method
is
general
,
and
applies
equally

or
to

The
system
consists
of
an

,
and
a

.
Two
algorithms
for
encoding
a

earlier
proposals
.
The
analysis
program
attempts
to
find
an
optimal

CAPS
is
a
highly
interactive
diagnostic
compiler
/
interpreter
that
allows
beginning
programmers
to
prepare
,
debug
,
and
execute
fairly
simple
programs
at
a
graphics
display
terminal
.
Complete
syntax
checking
and
most
semantic
analysis
is
performed
as
the
program
is
entered
and
as
it
is
subsequently
edited
.
Analysis
is
performed
character

character
.
The
most
remarkable
feature
of
CAPS
is
its
ability
to
automatically
diagnose
errors
both
at
compile
time
and
at
run
time
.
Errors
are
not
automatically
corrected
.
Instead
,
CAPS
interacts
with
the
student
to
help
him
find
the
cause
of
his
error
.
Most
components
of
CAPS
are
table
driven
,
both
to
reduce
the
space
needed
for
implementation
and
to
increase
the
flexibility
of
the
multilingual
system
.
Over
500
students
have
used
CAPS
to
learn
Fortran

A
significant
increase
in
the
capability
for
controlling
motion
dynamics
in
key
frame
animation
is
achieved
through
skeleton
control
.
This
technique
allows
an
animator
to
develop
a
complex
motion
sequence
by
animating
a
stick
figure
representation
of
an
image
.
This
control
sequence
is
then
used
to
drive
an
image
sequence
through

.
The
simplicity
of
the
stick

image
encourages
a
high
level
of

The
geometric
structure
inherent
in
the
definition
of
the
shapes
of
three
-
dimensional
objects
and
environments
is
used
not
just
to
define
their
relative
motion
and
placement
,
but
also
to
assist
in
solving
many
other
problems
of
systems
for
producing
pictures
by
computer
.
By
using
an
extension
of
traditional
structure
information
,
or
a
geometric
hierarchy
,
five
significant
improvements
to
current
techniques
are
possible
.
First
,
the
range
of
complexity
of
an
environment
is
greatly
increased
while
the
visible
complexity
of
any
given
scene
is
kept
within
a
fixed
upper
limit
.
Second
,
a
meaningful
way
is
provided
to
vary
the
amount
of
detail
presented
in
a
scene
.
Third
,
"
clipping
"
becomes
a
very
fast
logarithmic
search
for
the
resolvable
parts
of
the
environment
within
the
field
of
view
.
Fourth
,
frame
to
frame
coherence
and
clipping
define
a
graphical
"
working
set
,
"
or
fraction
of
the
total
structure
that
should
be
present
in
primary
store
for
immediate
access
by
the
visible
surface
algorithm
.
Finally
,
the
geometric
structure
suggests
a
recursive
descent
,
visible
surface
algorithm
in
which
the
computation
time
potentially
grows
linearly
with
the
visible
complexity
of
the
scene
.

Texture

.W
In
1974
Catmull
developed
a
new
algorithm
for
rendering
images
of
bivariate
surface
patches
.
This
paper
describes
extensions
of
this
algorithm
in
the
areas
of
texture
simulation
and
lighting
models
.
The
parameterization
of
a
patch
defines
a
coordinate
system
which
is
used
as
a
key
for
mapping
patterns
onto
the
surface
.
The
intensity
of
the
pattern
at
each
picture
element
is
computed
as
a
weighted
average
of
regions
of
the
pattern
definition
function
.
The
shape
and
size
of
this
weighting
function
are
chosen
using
digital
signal
processing
theory
.
The
patch
rendering
algorithm
allows
accurate
computation
of
the
surface
normal
to
the
patch
at
each
picture
element
,
permitting
the
simulation
of
the
mirror
reflections
.
The
amount
of
light
coming
from
a
given
direction
is
modeled
in
a
similar
manner
to
the
texture
mapping
and
then
added
to
the
intensity
obtained
from
the
texture
mapping
.
Several

of
images

using
these

techniques
are

Context

provide
a
convenient
way
of

which
is
to
be
viewed
as
a

of

.
This
note
presents
an
algorithm
which
improves
on
previous

tree
retrieval
algorithms
.
It
is
based
on
the
observation
that
in
typical
uses
context
changes
are
infrequent
relative
to
retrievals
,
so
that
data
can
be
cached
to
speed
up
retrieval
.
A
retrieval
is
started
from
the
position
of
the
previous

and
auxiliary

are
built
up
to
make
the
search
rapid

for

This
paper
describes
a
new
way
of
solving
the
storage
reclamation
problem
for
a
system
such
as
Lisp
that
allocates
storage
automatically
from
a
heap
,
and
does
not
require
the
programmer
to
give
any
indication
that
particular
items
are
no
longer
useful
or
accessible
.
A
reference
count
scheme
for
reclaiming

,
and
a
linearizing
,
compacting
,
copying
scheme
to
reorganize
all
storage
at
the
users
discretion
are
proposed
.
The
algorithms
are
designed
to
work
well
in
systems
which
use
multiple
levels
of
storage
,
and
large
virtual
address
space
.
They
depend
on
the
fact
that
most

are
referenced
exactly
once
,
and
that
reference
counts
need
only
be
accurate
when
storage
is
about
to
be
reclaimed
.
A
transaction

stores
changes
to

,
and
a
multiple

table
stores
the
count
for
items
which
are

Analysis

.W
A
real
time
garbage
collection
system
avoids
suspending
the
operations
of
a
list
processor
for
the
long
times
that
garbage
collection
normally
requires
by
performing
garbage
collection
on
a
second
processor
in
parallel
with
list
processing
operations
,
or
on
a
single
processor
time
-
shared
with
them
.
Algorithms
for
recovering
discarded
list
structures
in
this
manner
are
presented
and
analyzed
to
determine
sufficient
conditions
under
which
the
list
processor
never
needs
to
wait
on
the
collector
.
These
techniques
are
shown
to
require
at
most
twice
as
much
processing
power
as
regular
garbage
collectors
,
if
they
are
used
efficiently
.
The
average
behavior
of
the
program
is
shown
to
be
very

equal
to
the

so
that

Compressed

This

presents
a
new
data
structure
,
called
a
compressed
trie
or
C
-
trie
,
to
be
used
in
information
retrieval
systems
.
It
has
the
same
underlying
m
-
ary
tree
structure
as
a
trie
,
where
m
is
a
parameter
of
the
trie
,
but
whereas
the
fields
of
the
nodes
in
a
trie
have
to
be
large
enough
to
hold
a
key
or
at
least
a
pointer
,
the
fields
in
a
C
-
trie
are
only
one
bit
long
.
In
the
analysis
part
of
the
paper
it
will
be
shown
that
for
a
collection
of
n
keys
the
retrieval
time
,
measured
in
terms
of
bit
inspections
of
one
key
,
is
of
the

(

and
the
storage
requirement

the
order
n

.
This
improvement
in
storage
requirements
and
retrieval
time
is
achieved
at
the
cost
of
decreasing
the
flexibility
of
the
structure
,
and
therefore
updating
costs
are
increased
.
First
the

The

Formal
Verification

Parallel
Programs
Formal+Verification
Parallel+Programs
.W
Two
formal
models
for
parallel
computation
are
presented
:
an
abstract
conceptual
model
and
a
parallel
-
program
model
.
The
former
model
does
not
distinguish
between
control
and
data
states
.
The
latter
model
includes
the
capability
for
the
representation
of
an
infinite
set
of
control
states
by
allowing
there
to
be
arbitrarily
many
instruction
pointers
(
or
processes
)
executing
the
program
.
An
induction
principle
is
presented
which
treats
the
control
and
data
state
sets
on
the
same
ground
.
Through
the
use
of
"
place
variables
,
"
it
is
observed
that
certain
correctness
conditions
can
be
expressed
without
enumeration
of
the
set
of
all
possible
control
states
.
Examples
are
presented
in
which
the
induction
principle
is
used
to
demonstrate
proofs
of
mutual
exclusion
.
It
is
shown
that
assertions
-
oriented
proof
methods
are
special
cases
of
the
induction
principle
.
A
special
case
of
the
assertions
method
,
which
is
called
parallel
place
assertions
,
is
shown
to
be
incomplete
.
A
formalization
of
"
deadlock
"
is
then
presented
.
The
concept
of
a
"
norm
"
is
introduced
,
which
yields
an
extension
,
to
the
deadlock
problem
,
of
Floyd
's
technique
for
proving
termination
.
Also
discussed
is
an
extension
of
the
program
model
which
allows
each
process
to
have
its
own
local
variables
and
permits
shared
global
variables
.
Correctness
of
certain
forms
of
implementation
is
also
discussed
.

Appendix
is

The

The+Synthetic
Synthetic+Approach
Decision+Table
Table+Conversion
.W
Previous
approaches
to
the
problem
of
automatically
converting
decision
tables
to
computer
programs
have
been
based
on
decomposition
.
At
any
stage
,
one
condition
is
selected
for
testing
,
and
two
smaller
problems
(
decision
tables
with
one
less
condition
)
are
created
.
An
optimal
program
(
with
respect
to
average
execution
time
or
storage
space
,
for
example
)
is
located
only
through
implicit
enumeration
of
all
possible
decision
trees
using
a
technique
such
as
branch
-
and
-
bound
.
The
new
approach
described
in
this
paper
uses
dynamic
programming
to
synthesize
an
optimal
decision
tree
from
which
a
program
can
be
created
.
Using
this
approach
,
the
efficiency
of
creating
an
optimal
program
is
increased
substantially
,
permitting
generation
of
optimal
programs
for
decision
tables
with
as
many
as
ten
to
twelve
conditions
.

Referencing
Lists
by
an
Edge
Referencing+Lists
.W
An
edge
reference
into
a
list
structure
is
a
pair
of
pointers
to
adjacent
nodes
.
Such
a
reference
often
requires
little
additional
space
,
but
its
use
can
yield
efficient
algorithms
.
For
instance
,
a
circular
link
between
the
ends
of
a
list
is
redundant

if
the
list
is
always
referenced
by
that
edge
,
and
list
traversal
is
easier
when
that
link
is
null
.
Edge
references

following
conditions
:
(

the
length

the

there

an

Characteristics
of
Program
Localities
Program+Localities
.W
The
term
"
locality
"
has
been
used
to
denote
that
subset
of
a
program
's
segments
which
are
referenced
during
a
particular
phase
of
its
execution
.
A
program
'
s
behavior
can
be
characterized
in
terms
of
its
residence
in
localities
of
various
sizes
and
lifetimes
,
and
the
transitions
between
these
localities
.
In
this
paper
the
concept
of
a
locality
is
made
more
explicit
through
a
formal
definition
of
what
constitutes
a
phase
of
localized
reference
behavior
,
and
by
a
corresponding
mechanism
for
the
detection
of
localities
in
actual
reference
strings
.
This
definition
provides
for
the
existence
of
a
hierarchy
of
localities
at
any
given
time
,
and
the
reasonableness
of
the
definition
is
supported
by
examples
taken
from
actual
programs
.
Empirical
data
from
a
sample
of
production
Algol

is
used
to
display
distributions
of

sizes
and

,
and
these

are
discussed
in

of
their

for
the
modeling

program

the

This

investigates
mechanisms
that

These
mechanisms
are
examined
within
a
mathematical
framework
suitable
for
formulating
the

The

the

is
a

derived
from
the
security
classes
and
justified
by
the
semantics
of

The

permit
concise
formulations
of
the

of
different

and
facilitate
the

of

that

The

provides
a

of

that

,
enables
a
classification
of
them

Most

termination

As

this

conducting
a

using

Intentional+Resolution

.W
Traditionally
,
privacy
protection
in
database
systems
is
understood
to
be
the
control
over
what
information
a
given
user
can
get
from
a
database
.
This
paper
is
concerned
with
another
,
independent
,
dimension
of
privacy
protection
,
the
control
over
what
a
user
is
allowed
to
do
with
a
piece
of
information
supplied
to
him
by
the
database
.
The
ability
to
condition
the
supply
of
information
on
its
intended
use
is
called
here
"
intentional
resolution
"
of
privacy
protection
.
The
practical
importance
of
intentional
resolution
is
demonstrated
by
several
examples
,
and
its
realization
is
discussed
.
It
is
shown
that
intentional
resolution
can
be
achieved
,
but
that
it
involves
a
radical
change
from
the
traditional
approach
to
the
process
of
user
-
database
interaction
.
In
particular
,
it
appears
to
be
necessary
for
the
database
to
impose
a
certain
amount
of
control
over
the
internal
behavior
of
users
'
programs
which
interact
with
it
.
A
model
for
user

which
admits
such
a

The

.W
This
paper
presents
a
method
for
detecting
edges
and
contours
in
noisy
pictures
.
The
properties
of
an
edge
are
embedded
in
a
figure
of
merit
and
the
edge
detection
problem
becomes
the
problem
of
minimizing
the
given
figure
of
merit
.
This
problem
can
be
represented
as
a
shortest
path
problem
on
a
graph
and
can
be
solved
using
well
-
known
graph
search
algorithms
.
The
relations
between
this
representation
of
the
minimization
problem
and
a
dynamic
programming
approach
are
discussed
,
showing
that
the
graph
search
method
can
lead
to
substantial
improvements
in
computing
time
.
Moreover
,
if
heuristic
search
methods
are
used
,
the
computing
time
will
depend
on
the
amount
of
noise
in
the
picture
.
Some
experimental
results
are
given
;
these
show
how
various
information
about
the
shape
of
the
contour
of
an
object
can
be
embedded
in
the
figure
of
merit
,
thus
allowing
the
extraction
of
contours
from
noisy
picture
and
the
separation
of
touching
objects
.

Cobol
was
studied
because
of
economic
importance
,
widespread

,
possible

-
including
design
,
and
lack
of
research
.
The
types
of
errors
were
identified
in
a
pilot
study
;
then
,
using
the
132
error
types
found
,
1,777
errors
were
classified
in
1,4000
runs
of
73
Cobol
students
.
Error
density
was
high
:
20
percent
of
the
types
contained
80
percent
of
the
total
frequency
,
which
implies
high
potential
effectiveness
for
software
based
correction
of
Cobol
.
Surprisingly
,
only
four
high
-
frequency
errors
were
error
-
prone
,
which
implies
minimal
error
inducing
design
.
80
percent
of
Cobol
misspellings
were
classifiable
in
the
four
error
categories
of
previous
researchers
,
which
implies
that
Cobol
misspellings
are
correctable
by
existent
algorithms
.
Reserved
word
usage
was
not

,
which
implies

Over
80

to

constructed

one

message
routing

the
other
to
illustrate
the
equilibrium
(

)
maintained
by
an
adaptive

algorithm
.
These
models
show
that
adaptive
routing
does
not
satisfy
the
necessary
conditions
for
an
optimal
routing
,
Adaptive
routing
tends
to
overuse
the
direct
path
and
underuse
alternate
routes
because
it
does
not
consider
the
impact
of
its
current
routing
decision
on
the
future
state
of
the
network
.
The
form
of
the
optimality
conditions
suggests
that
a
modification
of
the
adaptive
algorithm
will
result
in
optimality
.
The
modification
requires

Computers
as
an
Innovation
in
American
Local
Governments
American+Local
Local+Governments
.W
Computers
and
electronic
data
processing
are
a
major
technological
innovation
in
the
operations
of
American
local
government
.
This
paper
establishes
that
there
is
substantial
variation
among
the
larger
local
governments
in
the
rate
at
which
they
adopt
computer
technology
,
in
the
level
of
financial
support
they
provide
for
EDP
,
and
in
the
extensiveness
and
sophistication
of
their
automated
applications
.
The
central
question
addressed
is
:
What
might
explain
the
differences
between
governments
in
the
extent
to
which
they
adopt
and
use
computers
?
Hypotheses
are
tested
for
several
streams
of
explanatory
factors
,
using
data
from
more
than
500
city
and
county
governments
.
The
findings
identify
certain
local
government
milieus
which
are
particularly
conducive
to
higher
levels
of
computer
innovation
.
Somewhat
unexpected
findings
reveal
the
significant
impact
of
the
distribution
of
control
over
EDP
decisions
and
the
dominant
political
values
within
the
government
.
Other
important
factors
include
the
measured
need
for
computer
applications
and
the
presence
of
external
funding
support
for
computing
.
Finally
,
the
paper
suggests
a
framework
for
identifying
the
key
determinants
of
other
technological
innovations

.W
Recent
developments
in
optimizing
techniques
have
allowed
a
new
design
for
compilers
to
emerge
.
Such
a
compiler
translates
the
parsed
source
code
into
lower
level
code
by
a
sequence
of
steps
.
Each
step
expands
higher
level
statements
into
blocks
of
lower
level
code
and
then
performs
optimizations
on
the
result
.
Each
statement
has
only
one
possible
expansion
-
the
task
of
tailoring
this
code
to
take
advantage
of
any
special
cases
is
done
by
the
optimizations
.
This
paper
provides
evidence
that
this
strategy
can
indeed
result
in
good
object
code
.
The
traditionally
difficult
PL
/
I
concatenate
statement
was
investigated
as
a
detailed
example
.
A
set
of
fairly
simple
optimizations
was
identified
which
allow
the
compiler
to
produce
good
code
.
More
elaborate
optimizations
can
further
improve
the
object
code
.
For
most
contexts
of
the
concatenate
statement
,
the
code
produced
by
a
compiler
using
the
expansion
-
optimization
strategy
described
above
compares
favorably
with

two

translated
into
recursive
algorithms
in

a
method
of
recursion

.W
A
refinement
of
hashing
which
allows
retrieval
of
an
item
in
a
static
table
with
a
single
probe
is
considered
.
Given
a
set
I
of
identifiers
,
two
methods
are
presented
for
building
,
in
a
mechanical
way
,
perfect
hashing
functions
,
i
.
e
.
functions
transforming
the
elements
of
I
into
unique
addresses
.
The
first
method
,
the
"
quotient
reduction
"
method
,
is
shown
to
be
complete
in
the
sense
that
for
every
set
I
the
smallest
table
in
which
the
elements
of
I
can
be
stored
and
from
which
they
can
be
retrieved
by
using
a
perfect
hashing
function
constructed
by
this
method
can
be
found
.
However
,
for
nonuniformly
distributed
sets
,
this
method
can
give
rather
sparse
tables
.
The
second
method
,
the
"
remainder
reduction
"
method
,
is
not
complete
in
the
above
sense
,
but
it
seems
to
give
minimal
(
or
almost
minimal
)
tables
for
every
kind
of
set
.
The
two
techniques
are
applicable
directly
to
small
sets
.
Some
methods
to
extend
these
results
to
larger
sets
are
also
presented
.
A
rough
comparison
with
ordinary
hashing
is
given
which
shows
that
this
method
can
be
used
conveniently
in
several
practical
applications

Anomalous

.W
This

reports
simulation

showing
that
,
in
dynamic

allocation
,
the
average
free
-
to
-
allocated
-
block
ratio
can
differ
considerably
and
in
both
directions
from
the
predictions
of
the
50
percent
rule
.
A
new
derivation
is
given
,
and
it
is
shown
that
previous
derivations
make
an
assumption
that
may
be
violated
frequently
.
On
the
basis
of
the
simulation
data
and
the
derivation
,
it
is
hypothesized
that
the
anomalous
behavior
results
from
the
combined
effects
of
systematic
placement
and
the
statistics
of
the
release
process
.
Additional
simulations
support
this
hypothesis
.
Systematic
placement
,
which
refers
to
the
natural
convention
of
always
allocating
storage
requests
against
the
same
end
of
the
free
block
selected
by
the
allocation
strategy
,
tends
to
order
blocks
within
contiguous
groups
according
to
their
allocation
time
.
The
degree
of
anomalous
behavior
depends
on
the
extent
to
which
allocated
blocks
are
released
in
the
order
of
their
allocation
.
For
non
-
Markovian
release
processes
,
the
extent
of
the
correlation
between
allocation
order
and
release
order
varies
approximately
inversely
with
the
coefficient
of
variation
of
the
memory
residence
time
distribution
.
The
simulations
show
that
allocation
efficiency
depends
strongly
on
the
residence
time
distribution
;
efficiency
decreases
as
the

.W
An
algorithm
is
presented
that
searches
for
the
location
,
"
i

"
of
the
first
occurrence
of
a
character
string
,
"
pat
,
"
in

string
,
"

.
"
During
the
search
operation
,
the
characters
of
pat
are
matched
starting
with
the
last
character
of
pat
.
The
information
gained
by
starting
the
match
at
the
end
of
the
pattern
often
allows
the
algorithm
to
proceed
in
large
jumps
through
the
text
being
searched
.
Thus
the
algorithm
has
the
unusual
property
that
,
in
most
cases
,
not
all
of
the
first
i
characters
of
string
are
inspected
.
The
number
of
characters
actually
inspected
(
on
the
average
)
decreases
as
a
function
of
the
length
of
pat
.
For
a
random
English
pattern
of
length
5
,
the
algorithm
will
typically
inspect
i
/
4
characters
of
string
before
finding
a
match
at
i
.
Furthermore
,
the
algorithm
has
been
implemented
so
that
(
on
the
average
)
fewer
than
i
+
patlen
machine
instructions
are
executed
.
These
conclusions
are
supported
with
empirical
evidence
and
a
theoretical
analysis
of
the
average
behavior
of
the
algorithm
.
The
worst

The

of

of

When

specifies
its

by

a

to
the

and
its
in

as
a

between
the

allows
formalization
of

The

Formally

,
and

regular

,
since
these

Level

Structure
for
Nondeterministic
Programming
Level+Control
Control+Structure
Nondeterministic+Programming
.W
The
basic
ideas
of
nondeterministic
programming
are
critically
reconsidered
to
single
out
a
proper
attitude
and
programming
style
for
language
allowing
direct
control
of
nondeterministic
features
.
The
proposed
attitude
aims
at
retaining
the
purity
of
the
nondeterministic
formulation
of
search
processes
on
one
level
(
the
attempt
level
)
,
deferring
the
coordination
of
problem
solving
efforts
to
another
(
the
choice
level
)
.
The
feasibility
of
recognizing
these
two
levels
is
discussed
,
stressing
that
the
structure
to
be
managed
at
the
choice
level
is
a
free
of
contexts
.
The
leaves
are
computational
environments
,
each
holding
an
alternative
under
inspection
,
while
the
other
nodes
are
associated
with
choice
poin
ts
.
According
to
the
proposed
programming
style
,
a
generative
function
is
associated
with
each
choice
poin
t
,
which
expresses
the
desired
choice
strategy
.
The
main
advantage
on
this
approach
is
the
localization
of
the
search
strategies
:
Each
nonterminal
node
of
the
tree
keeps
track
of
the
state
of
the
computation
as
it
was
when
the
choice
poin
t
was
last
interrogated
,
holding
at
the
same
time
the
strategy
to
coordinate
the
available
alternatives
.

An
in

computer
graphics
method
has
been
developed
for
the
rapid
generation
of
arbitrary
shaped
three
-

surfaces
.
The
method
is
a
synthesis
of

algorithms
,
an
in

means
for
man

machine
communication
,
and
software
for

.
The
basic
technique
employed
is
a
modified
lofting
method
on
which
sectional
curves
are
represented
by
uniform
B
-
splines
and
the
surface
is
in
terpolated
between
sections
by
Cardinal
splines
.
Among
the
features
of
this
method
are
algorithms
which
enable
in
teractive
modification
of
the
B

representation
of
the

At

of
the
process

In

a

solid

be
reconstructed
from
serial

,
either
to
aid

This
paper
presents
a
general

to
the
problem
of
constructing
a
surface
over
a
set
of
cross

sectional
contours
.
This
surface
,
to
be
composed
of
triangular
tiles
,
is
constructed
by
separately
determining
an
optimal
surface
between
each
pair
of
consecutive
contours
.
Determining
such
a
surface
is
reduced
to
the
problem
of
finding
certain
minimum
cost
cycles
in
a
directed
toroidal
graph
.
A

.W
An
optimization
technique
known
as
inline
substitution
is
analyzed
.
The
optimization
consists
of
replacing
a
procedure
invocation
by
a
modified
copy
of
the
procedure
body
.
The
general
problem
of
using
inline
substitution
to
minimize
execution
time
subject
to
size
constrain
ts
is
formulated
,
and
an
approximate
algorithmic
solution
is
proposed
.
The
algorithm
depends
on
run
-
time
statistics
about
the
program
to
be
optimized
.
Preliminary
results
for
the
CLU
structured
programming
language
indicate
that
,
in
programs
with
a
low
degree
of
recursion
,
over
90
percent
of
all
procedure
calls
can
be
eliminated
,
with
little
increase
in
the
size
of
compiled
code
and
a
small
savings
in
execution
time
.
Other

Logic
and
Programming
Languages
Programming+Languages
.W
Logic
has
been
long
in
terested
in
whether
answers
to
certain
questions
are
computable
in
principle
,
since
the
outcome
puts
bounds
on
the
possibilities
of
formalization
.
More
recently
,
precise
comparisons
in
the
efficiency
of
decision
methods
have
become
available
through
the
developments
in
complexity
theory
.
These
,
however
,
are
applications
to
logic
,
and
a
big
question
is
whether
methods
of
logic
have
significance
in
the
other
direction
for
the
more
applied
parts
of
computability
theory
.
Programming
languages
offer
an
obvious
opportunity
as
their
syntactic
formalization
is
well
advanced
;
however
,
the
semantical
theory
can
hardly
be
said
to
be
complete
.
Though
we
have
many
examples
,
we
have
still
to
give
wide
-
ranging
mathematical
answers
to
these
queries
:
What
is
a
machine
?
What
is
a
computable
process
?
How
(
or
how
well
)
does
a
machine
simulate
a
process
?
Programs
naturally
enter
in
giving
descriptions
of
processes
.
The
definition
of
the
precise
meaning
of
a
program
then
requires
us
to
explain
what
are
the
objects
of
computation
(
in
a
way
,
the
statics
of
the
problem
)
and
how
they
are
to
be
transformed
(
the
dynamics
)
.
So
far
the
theories
of
automata
and
of
nets
,
though
most
in
teresting
for
dynamics
,
have
formalized
only
a
portion
of
the
field
,
and
there
has
been
perhaps
too
much
concentration
on
the
finite
-
state
and
algebraic
aspects
.
It
would
seem
that
the
understanding
of
higher
-
level
program
features
involves
us
with
infinite
objects
and
forces
us
to
pass
through
several
levels
of
explanation
to
go
from
the
conceptual
ideas
to
the
final
simulation
on
a
real
machine
.
These
levels
can
be
made
mathematically
exact
if
we
can
find
the
right
abstractions
to
represent
the
necessary
structures
.
The
experience
of
many
independent
workers
with
the
method
of
data
types
as
lattices
(
or
partial
orderings
)
under
an
information
content
ordering
,
and
with
their
continuous
mappings
,
has
demonstrated
the
flexibility
of
this
approach
in
providing
definitions
and
proofs
,
which
are
clean
and
without
undue
dependence
on
implementations
.
Nevertheless
much
remains
to
be
done
in
showing
how
abstract
conceptualizations
can
(
or
cannot
)
be
actualized
before
we
can
say
we
have
a
unified
theory
.

Abstraction
Mechanisms

CLU
Abstraction+Mechanisms
.W
CLU
is
a
new
programming
language
designed
to
support
the
use
of
abstractions
in
program
construction
.
Work
in
programming
methodology
has
led
to
the
realization
that
three
kinds
of
abstractions
-
procedural
,
control
,
and
especially
data
abstractions
-
are
useful
in
the
programming
process
.
Of
these
,
only
the
procedural
abstraction
is
supported
well
by
conventional
languages
,
through
the
procedure
or
subroutine
.
CLU
provides
,
in
addition
to
procedures
,
novel
linguistic
mechanisms
that
support
the
use
of
data
and
control
abstractions
.
This
paper
provides
an
in

to
the
abstraction
mechanisms
in
CLU
.
By
means
of

examples
,
the
utility
of
the
three
kinds
of
abstractions
in

is
illustrated
,
and
it

how

may
be

Lucid

Lucid
is
a
formal
system
in
which
programs
can
be
written
and
proofs
of
programs
carried
out
.
The
proofs
are
particularly
easy
to
follow
and
straightforward
to
produce
because
the
statements
in
a
Lucid
program
are
simply
axioms
from
which
the
proof
proceeds
by
(
almost
)
conventional
logical
reasoning

axioms
and
rules
of
inference
for

functions
.
As
a
programming
language
,
Lucid
is
unconventional
because
,
among
other
things
,
the
order
of
statements
is
irrelevant
and
assignment
statements
are
equations
.
Nevertheless
,
Lucid
programs
need
not
look
much
different
than
iterative
programs
in

structured
programming
language

shown
that
at

certain

deduced
.
This

to
find

those
that

Information+Flow
.W
This
paper
presents
a
certification
mechanism
for
verifying
the
secure
flow
of
information
through
a
program
.
Because
it
exploits
the
properties
of
a
lattice
structure
among
security
classes
,
the
procedure
is
sufficiently
simple
that
it
can
easily
be
included
in
the
analysis
phase
of
most
existing
compilers
.
Appropriate
semantics
are
presented
and
proved
correct
.
An
important
application
is
the
confinement
problem
:
The
mechanism
can
prove
that
a
program
cannot
cause
supposedly
nonconfidential
results
to
depend
on
confidential
input
data
.

In

for
the
nodes
of
a
distributed
computer
network
to
communicate
,
each

must
have
information
about
the

Since

a

is
needed
to
update
this

One
of
the
major
constrain

on

that

scheme
for
classifying

algorithms
based
on
an

of

system
which
formalizes
the
notion

Various

related
to

A
criterion
for
the

is
developed
and
results
in
the
definition
of

For

the

The

provides
a

in

an

important
in
conceptualizing

Aggregation
transforms
a

under
certain
criteria

"

specifies
aggregation

Relational

The
system
for
business

)
is
a
system
within
which
application
experts
-
nonprogrammers
-
can
describe
and
execute
their
applications
on
a
computer
.
The
user
of
SBA
views
his
application
as
manipulation
of
information
in
two
-
dimensional
pictures
of
tables
,
business
forms
,
and
reports
on
a
display
terminal
.
He
can
gradually
automate
this
application
by
giving
"

to
the
system
of
how
he

Previously
published
algorithms
for
finding
the
longest
common
subsequence
of
two
sequences
of
length
n
have
had
a
best

case
running
time
of
O
(

An
algorithm
for
this
problem
is
presented
which
has
a
running
time
of
O
(
(
r

n

log
n
)
,
where
r
is
the
total
number
of
ordered
pairs
of
positions
at
which
the
two
sequences
match
.
Thus
in
the
worst
case
the
algorithm
has
a
running
time
of
O
(
n

log

)
.
However
,
for
those
applications
where
most
positions
of
one

match
relatively

,
a
running

can

expected

the
use

the

property
of

in
the
analysis
of

In
particular
,
it
describes
a
sequential
estimation
method
which
when
used
with
the
regenerative
property
allows
results
to
be
obtained
with
specified
statistical
accuracy
.
This
method
includes
a
test
to
check
the
normality
assumption
on
which
the
sequential
procedure
relies
.
The
paper
illustrates
the
method
using

as
the

.
A

then
describes
how

reduces
the

Research

However

the

A
class

structures
for
use
in
a
virtual
memory
environment
is
described
.
Design
alternatives
within
this
class
of
index
structures
are
analyzed
.
These
alternatives
include
a
choice
of
search
strategy
,
whether
or
not
pages
in
the
index
are
structured
,
and
whether
or
not
keys
are
compressed
.
The
average
cost
of
retrieving
entries
from
these
indexes
is
expressed
as
a
wieghted
sum
of
the
cost
of
a
basic
key
comparison
and
the
cost
of
crossing
a
page
boundary
in
the
index
structure
.
Formulas
for
the

for
possible
combinations
of
design

are
given
.
These
are
used
in

A

is
the
elimination
of
the
large

of
spurious

that
result
from
an
initial
segmentation
by
region

.
Such

have
been
eliminated
either
on

or
on
the
basis
of

.
A
scheme
is
presented
which
performs
eliminations
on
the
basis
of
local
properties
of
the

.
The
scheme
is
based
on
definitions
of
graph
properties
which
are
satisfied
when

relatively
high
levels

The
concept

answer
questions
like
:
How
many
registers
are

How

What

The
performance
of
information
retrieval
systems
can
be
evaluated
in
a
number
of
different
ways
.
Much
of
the
published
evaluation
work
is
based
on
measuring
the
retrieval
performance
of
an
average
user
query
.
Unfortunately
,
formal
proofs
are
difficult
to
construct
for
the
average
case
.
In
the
present
study
,
retrieval
evaluation
is
based
on
optimizing
the
performance
of
a
specific
user
query
.
The
concept
of
query
term
accuracy
is
in
troduced
as
the
probability
of
occurrence
of
a
query
term
in
the
documents
relevant
to
that
query
.
By
relating
term
accuracy
to
the
frequency
of
occurrence
of
the
term
in
the
documents
of
a
collection
it
is
possible
to
give
formal
proofs
of
the
effectiveness
with
respect
to
a
given
user
query
of
a
number
of
automatic
indexing
systems
that
have
been
used
successfully
in
experimental
situations
.
Among
these
are
inverse
document
frequency
weighting
,
thesaurus
construction
,
and
phrase
generation
.

An
investigation
into
the
average
queue
size
for
a
certain
class
of
queues
has
resulted
in
the
formulation
of
linear
programming
problems
which
are
ill
-
conditioned
in
some
cases
.
In
attempting
to
solve
these
linear
programming
models
,
using
IBM
'
s
MPS
package
,
instances
of
cycling
were
encountered
.
Small
perturbations
in
the
input
data
resulted
in
problems
which
did
not
cycle
.
This
fact
,
plus
several
other
observed
phenomena
suggest
that
the
primary
reason
that
cycling
is
not
known
to
occur
more
frequently
is
the
round
-
off
errors
in
the
computations
perturb
the
problem
sufficiently
to
prevent
cycling
(
or
at
least
to
prevent
indefinite
cycling
)
.
In
one
case
maximizing

minimizing

that

to
detect

One
of
the
main
objectives
in
the
design
of
a
file
system
is
the
reduction
of
storage
and
data
transfer
costs
.
This
paper
presents
a
model
in
which
several
requests
access
the
file
system
,
and
each
request
requires
information
from
one
or
more
variable
length
data
-
items
.
The
probabilities
of
access
and
the
distribution
of
each
data
-
item
's
length
are
assumed
to
be
known
,
and
to
be
mutually
independent
.
The
file
system
uses
one
or
more
storage
devices
,
and
each
record
may
be
partitioned
into
subrecords
that
are
stored
on
different
devices
.
One
of
the
subrecords
is
designated
as
the
primary
record
;
when
a
request
for
a
record
is
made
,
the
primary
record
is
first
accessed
,
and
other
subrecords
are
accessed
only
if
the
pertinent
information
is
not
stored
in
the
primary
record
.
The
model
that
is
presented
in
this
paper
,
both
as
a
nonlinear
programming
model
and
a
mixed
integer
programming
model
,
is
a
very
general
one
;
several
types
of

Based
on
an
empirical
study
of
more
than
10,000
lines
of
program
text
written
in
a
GOTO
-
less
language
,
a
machine
architecture
specifically
designed
for
structured
programs
is
proposed
.
Since
assignment
,
CALL
,
RETURN
,
and
IF
statements
together
account
for
93
percent
of
all
executable
statements
,
special
care
is
given
to
ensure
that
these
statements
can
be
implemented
efficiently
.
A
highly
compact
instruction
encoding
scheme
is
presented
,
which
can
reduce
program
size
by
a
factor
of
3
.
Unlike
a
Huffman
code
,
which
utilizes
variable
length
fields
,
this
method
uses
only
fixed
length
(
1
-
byte
)
op
code
and
address
fields
.
The
most
frequent
instructions
consist
of
a
single
1
-
byte
field
.
As
a
consequence
,
instruction
decoding
time
is
minimized
,
and
the
machine
is
efficient
with
respect
to
both
space
and
time
.

Preserving

in
Arrays
Preserving+Average

.W
Programmers
and
data
structure
designers
are
often
forced
to
choose
between
alternative
structures
.
In
storing
these
structures
,
preserving
logical
adjacencies
or
"
proximity
"
is
usually
an
important
consideration
.
The
combinatorial
problem
of
storing
arrays
as
various
kinds
of
list
structures
is
examined
.
Embeddings
of
graphs
are
used
to
model
the
loss
of
proximity
involved
in
such
storage
schemes
,
and
an
elementary
proof
that
arrays
cannot
be
stored
as
linear
lists
with
bounded
loss
of
proximity
is
presented
.
Average
loss
of
proximity
is
then
considered
,
and
it
is
shown
that
arrays
cannot
be
stored
as
linear
lists
with
only
bounded
loss
of
average
proximity
,
but
can
be
so
stored
in
binary
trees
.
The
former
result
implies
,
for
instance
,
that
row
major
order
is
an
asymptotically
optimal
storage
strategy
for
arrays
.

.W
Traditional
concepts
of
management
information
systems
(
MIS
)
bear
little
relation
to
the
information
systems
currently
in
use
by
top
management
in
most
US
local
governments
.
What
exists
is
management
-
oriented
computing
,
involving
the
use
of
relatively
unsophisticated
applications
.
Despite
the
unsophisticated
nature
of
these
systems
,
management
use
of
computing
is
surprisingly
common
,
but
also
varied
in
its
extent
among
local
governments
.
Management
computing
is
most
prevalent
in
those
governments
with
professional
management
practices
where
top
management
is
supportive
of
computing
and
tends
to
control
computing
decisions
and
where
department
users
have
less
control
over
design
and
implementation
activities
.
Finally
,
management
computing
clearly
has
impacts
for
top
managers
,
mostly
involving
improvements
in
decision
information
.

This

describes
two
operators
that
respond
to
step
edges
,
but
not
to
ramps
.
The
first
is
similar
to
the
digital
Laplacian
,
but
uses
the
max
,
rather
than
the
sum
,
of
the
x
and
y
second
differences
.
The
second
uses
the
difference
between
the
mean
and
median
gray
levels
in
a
neighborhood
.
The
outputs
obtained
from
these
operators
applied
to
a

are
compared
with
each

and
with
the

.W
This
paper
explores
a
technique
for
proving
the
correctness
and
termination
of
programs
simultaneously
.
This
approach
,
the
intermittent
-
assertion
method
,
involves
documenting
the
program
with
assertions
that
must
be
true
at
some
time
when
control
passes
through
the
corresponding
point
,
but
that
need
not
be
true
every
time
.
The
method
,
introduced
by
Burstall
,
promises
to
provide
a
valuable
complement
to
the
more
conventional
methods
.
The
intermittent
-
assertion
method
is
presented
with
a
number
of
examples
of
correctness
and
termination
proofs
.
Some
of
these
proofs
are
markedly
simpler
than
their
conventional
counterparts
.
On
the
other
hand
,
it
is
shown
that
a
proof
of
correctness
or
termination
by
any
of
the
conventional
techniques
can
be
rephrased
directly
as
a
proof
using
intermittent
assertions
.
Finally
,
it
is
shown
how
the
intermittent
-
assertion
method
can
be
applied
to
prove
the
validity
of
program
transformations
and
the
correctness
of
continuously
operating
programs

Relaxation
Methods

.W
The
problem
of
recovering
an
image
(
a
function
of
two
variables
)
from
experimentally
available
integrals
of
its
grayness
over
thin
strips
is
of
great
importance
in
a
large
number
of
scientific
areas
.
An
important
version
of
the
problem
in
medicine
is
that
of
obtaining
the
exact
density
distribution
within
the
human
body
from
X
-
ray
projections
.
One
approach
that
has
been
taken
to
solve
this
problem
consists
of
translating
the
available
information
into
a
system
of
linear
inequalities
.
The
size
and
the
sparsity
of
the
resulting
system
(
typically
,
25,000
inequalities
with
fewer
than
1
percent
of
the
coefficients
nonzero
)
makes
methods
using
successive
relaxations
computationally
attractive
,
as
compared
to
other
ways
of
solving
systems
of
inequalities
.
In
this
paper
,
it
is
shown
that
,
for
a
consistent
system
of
linear
inequalities
,
any
sequence
of
relaxarion
parameters
lying
strictly
between
0
and
2
generates
a
sequence
of
vectors
which
converges
to
a
solution
.
Under
the
same
assumptions
,
for
a
system
of
linear
equations
,
the
relaxation
method
converges
to
the
minimum
norm
solution
.
Previously
proposed
techniques
are
shown
to
be
special
cases
of
our
procedure
with
different
choices
of
relaxation
parameters
.
The
practical
consequences
for
image
reconstruction
of
the
choice
of
the
relaxation
parameters
are
discussed
.

.W
Kellerman
has
presented
a
method
for
determining
keyword
conflicts
and
described
a
heuristic
algorithm
which
solves
a
certain
combinatorial
optimization
problem
in
connection
with
this
method
.
This
optimization
problem
is
here
shown
to
be
equivalent
to
the
problem
of
covering
the
edges
of
a
graph
by
complete
subgraphs
with
the
objective
of
minimizing
the
number
of
complete
subgraphs
.
A
relationship
between
this
edge
-
clique
-
cover
problem
and
the
graph
coloring
problem
is
established
which
allows
algorithms
for
either
one
of
these
problems
to
be
constructed
from
algorithm
for
the
other
.
As
consequences
of
this
relationship
,
the
keyword
conflict
problem
and
the
edge
-
clique
-
cover
problem
are
shown
to
be
NP
-
complete
,
and
if
P
=

NP
then
they
do
not
admit
polynomial

algorithms
which
always
produce
solutions
within
a

less

optimum

The

algorithm
presented
by
Strong

is
amplified

applied
to
a
relatively
complex

is
to
demonstrate

techniques
on
something
more
complex
than
Knuth

and
to
obtain

in

and
the
savings
achievable
via

in
the
presence

.
First
,
the
paper
describes
the
recursion

process
and
the
example
on
which
it
will
be
illustrated
.
Recursion

A
Method
for
Obtaining
Digital
Signatures
and
Public
-
Key
Cryptosystems
A+Method
Obtaining+Digital
Digital+Signatures
Key+Cryptosystems
.W
An
encryption
method
is
presented
with
the
novel
property
that
publicly
revealing
an
encryption
key
does
not
thereby
reveal
the
corresponding
decryption
key
.
This
has
two
important
consequences
:
(
1
)
Couriers
or
other
secure
means
are
not
needed
to
transmit
keys
,
since
a
message
can
be
enciphered
using
an
encryption
key
publicly
revealed
by
the
intended
recipient
.
Only
he
can
decipher
the
message
,
since
only
he
knows
the
corresponding
decryption
key
.
(
2
)
A
message
can
be
"
signed
"
using
a
privately
held
decryption
key
.
Anyone
can
verify
this
signature
using
the
corresponding
publicly
revealed
encryption
key
.
Signatures
cannot
be
forged
,
and
a
signer
cannot
later
deny
the
validity
of
his
signature
.
This
has
obvious
applications
in
"
electronic
mail
"
and
"
electronic
funds
transfer
"
systems
.
A
message
is
encrypted
by
representing
it
as
a
number
M
,
raising
M
to
a
publicly
specified
power
e
,
and
then
taking
the
remainder
when
the
result
is
divided
by
the
publicly
specified
product
,
n
,
of
two
large
secret
prime
numbers
p
and
q
.
Decryption
is
similar
;
only
a

,

d
is
used
,
where
e
*
d
=
1
(
mod
(
p
-
1
)
*
(
q

)
.
the
security
of
the
system
rests
in
part
on
the
difficulty
of
factoring
the
published
divisor

Hierarchical
programming
is
being
increasingly
recognized
as
helpful
in
the
construction
of
large

.
Users
of
hierarchical
techniques
claim
or
predict
substantial
increases
in
productivity
and
in
the
reliability
of
the
programs
produced
.
In
this
paper
we
describe
a
formal
method
for
hierarchical
program
specification
,
implementation
,
and
proof
.
We
apply
this
method
to
a
significant
list
processing
problem
and
also
discuss
a
number
of
extensions
to
current
programming
languages
that
ease
hierarchical
program
design
and
proof
.

Abstract

and

Abstract+Data
Data+Types

.W
A
data
abstraction
can
be
naturally
specified
using
algebraic
axioms
.
The
virtue
of
these
axioms
is
that
they
permit
a
representation
-
independent
formal
specification
of
a
data
type
.
An
example
is
given
which
shows
how
to
employ
algebraic
axioms
at
successive
levels
of
implementation
.
The
major
thrust
of
the
paper
is
twofold
.
First
,
it
is
shown
how
the
use
of
algebraic
axiomatizations
can
simplify
the
process
of
proving
the
correctness
of
an
implementation
of
an
abstract
data
type
.
Second
,
semi
-
automatic
tools
are
described
which
can
be
used
both
to
automate
such
proofs
of
correctness
and
to
derive
an
immediate
implementation
from
the
axioms
.
This
implementation
allows
for
limited
testing
of
programs
at
design
time
,
before
a
conventional
implementation
is
accomplished
.

A
broadcast
packet
is
for

of
a

.
Algorithms
for
accomplishing
this

through

(

reverse

a

method
which
exploits

Reverse

is
a

for

The

is
described
as
being
practical
because
it
is

optimal
according
to
metrics
developed
for
its
analysis
in
this
paper

and
also
because
it
can
be

with
less

than
that
required
for

known

Optimal
decision
table
conversion
has
been
tackled
in
the
literature
using
two
approaches
,
dynamic
programming
and
branch
-
and
-
bound
.
The
former
technique
is
quite
effective
,
but
its
time
and
space
requirements
are
independent
of
how
"
easy
"
the
given
table
is
.
Furthermore
,
it
cannot
be
used
to
produce
good
,
quasi
optimal
solutions
.
The
branch
-
and
-
bound
technique
uses
a
good
heuristic
to
direct
the
search
,
but
is
cluttered
up
by
an
enormous
search
space
,
since
the
number
of
solutions
increases
with
the
number
of
test
variables
according
to
a
double
exponential
.
In
this
paper
we
suggest
a
heuristically
guided
top
-
down
search
algorithm
which
,
like
dynamic
programming
,
recognizes
identical
subproblems
but
which
can
be
used
to
find
both
optimal
and
quasi
optimal
solutions
.
The
heuristic
search
method
introduced
in
this
paper
combines
the
positive
aspects
of
the
above
two
techniques
.
Compressed
tables
with
a
large

of
variables
can
be
handled
without
deriving
expanded

An

reduced
the

The

Split
trees
are
a
new
technique
for
searching
sets
of
keys
with
highly
skewed
frequency
distributions
.
A
split
tree
is
a
binary
search
tree
each
node
of
which
contains
two
key
values
-
a
node
value
which
is
a
maximally
frequent
key
in
that
subtree
,
and
a
split
value
which
partitions
the
remaining
keys
(
with
respect
to
their
lexical
ordering
)
between
the
left
and
right
subtrees
.
A
median
split
tree
(
MST
)
uses
the
lexical
median
of
a
node
's
descendents
as
its
split
value
to
force
the
search
tree
to
be
perfectly
balanced
,
achieving
both
a
space
efficient
representation
of
the
tree
and
high
search
speed
.
Unlike
frequency
ordered
binary
search
trees
,
the
cost
of
a
successful
search
of
an
MST
is
log
n
bounded
and
very
stable
around
minimal
values
.
Further
,
an
MST
can
be
built
for
a
given
key
ordering
and
set
of
frequencies
in

,
as

A
language
concept
for
concurrent
processes
without
common
variables
is
introduced
.
These
processes
communicate
and
synchronize
by
means
of
procedure
calls
and
guarded
regions
.
This
concept
is
proposed
for
real
-
time
applications
controlled
by
microcomputer
networks
with
distributed
storage
.
The
paper
gives
several
examples
of
distributed

shows
that
they
include
procedures

A
number
of
image
analysis
tasks
can
benefit
from
registration
of
the
image
with
a
model
of
the
surface

imaged
.
Automatic
navigation
using
visible
light
or
radar
images
requires
exact
alignment
of
such
images
with
digital
terrain
models
.
In
addition
,
automatic
classification
of
terrain
,
using
satellite
imagery
,
requires
such
alignment
to
deal
correctly
with
the
effects
of
varying
sun
angle
and
surface
slope
.
Even
inspection
techniques
for
certain
industrial

may
be
improved
by
this
means
.
We
achieve
the
required
alignment
by
matching
the
real
image
with
a
synthetic
image
obtained
from
a
surface

and
known
positions

A
technique
is
described
for

In
the
model
a

replaces
the

Simulation

without

SEMBEGS
is
a

graphical

containing
components
for
handling
graphical
data
files
,
for
displaying
the
contents
of
these
files
on
a
variety
of
graphical
hardware
,
and
for
performing
graphical
batch

operations
.
SEMBEGS
is
easy
to
extend
and
modify
to
meet
the
growing
needs
of
a
large
batch
environment
,
and
is
even
extendable
to
a

The

presents
the
conceptual
view
of
graphics
leading
to
the
design
of
SEMBEGS
and
outlines
the
major
components
of
the

The
design
of
SEMBEGS
is
founded
upon
the
basic
assumption
that
the
true
aim
of
computer
graphics
is
to
describe
graphical
entities
,
rather
than
,
as
commonly
held

to
provide

SEMBEGS

built
around
a
Basic

which
provides
a
common
means
of
communicating
the
descriptions
of

It
is
possible
to
use
a
small
counter
to
keep
approximate
counts
of
large
numbers
.
The
resulting
expected
error
can
be
rather
precisely
controlled
.
An
example
is
given
in
which
8
-
bit
counters
(
bytes
)
are
used
to
keep
track
of
as
many
as
130,000
events
with
a
relative
error
which
is
substantially
independent
of
the
number
n
of
events
.
This
relative
error
can
be
expected
to
be
24
percent
or
less
95
percent
of
the
time
(
i

The
techniques
could
be
used
to
advantage
in

hardware
or

used
for
the
monitoring
of

or

This
paper
investigates
the
problem
of
optimal
his
togram
matching
using
monotone
gray
level
transformation
,
which
always
assigns
all
picture
points
of
a
given
gray

another
gray

T
(
i
)
such
that
if
i
>
j
,
then
T
(

>
T
(

.
The
objective
is
to
find
a
transformed
digital
picture
of
a
given
picture
such
that
the
sum
of
absolute
errors
between
the
gray
level
his
togram
of
the
transformed
picture
and
that
of
a
reference
picture
is
minimized
.
This
is
equivalent
to
placing
k1
linearly
ordered
objects
of
different
sized
one
by
one
into
k2
linearly
ordered
boxes
of
assorted
sizes
,
such
that
the
accumulated
error
of
space
under
packed
or
overpacked
in
the
boxes
is
minimized
;
the
placement
function
is
monotonic
,
which
ensures
a
polynomial
time
solution
to
this
problem
.
A
tree
search
algorithm
for
optimal
his
togram

is
presented
which
has
time
complexity
O
(
k1

If
the
monotone
property
is

then
the
problem
becomes

if
it

The

here
consists
of
two
major

The
first
part
addresses
the
familiar
problem
of
event

efficiency
when
the
number
of
scheduled
events
grows
large
.
The
second
part
deals
with
the
less
apparent
problem
of
providing
efficiency
and
flexibility
as
scheduled
events
are
accessed
to
be
executed
.
Additional
features
and
problems
dealt
with
include
the
proper
handling
of
simultaneous
events
;
that
certain
events
must
be
created
,
scheduled
,
and
executed
at
the

that
infinite

The

concept
is
extended
for
programs
that
reference
segments
of
different

.
The
generalized
working

set
policy
(
GWS
)
keeps
as
its
resident
set
those
segments
whose
retention
costs
do
not
exceed
their
retrieval
costs
.
The
GWS
is
a
model
for
the
entire
class
of
demand
-
fetching
memory
policies
that
satisfy
a
resident

set
inclusion
property
.
A
generalized
optimal
policy
(
GOPT
)
is
also
defined
;
at
its
operating
points
it
minimizes
aggregated
retention
and

Special

A

algorithm
is
presented
and
analyzed
.
The
algorithm
associates
with
each
procedure
in
a
program
information
about
which
variables
may
be
modified
,
which
may
be
used
,
and
which
are
possibly
preserved
by
a
call
on
the

,
and
all
of
its
subcalls
.
The
algorithm
is
sufficiently
powerful
to
be
used
on
recursive
programs
and
to
deal
with
the
sharing
of
variables
which
arises
through
reference
parameters
.
The
algorithm
is
unique
in
that
it
can
compute
all
of
this
information
in
a
single
pass
,
not
requiring
a
prepass
to
compute
calling

During
the
last
few

,
computer

systems
which
automate
the
transfer
and
recording
of
debits
and
credits
have
begun
to
be
implemented
on
a
large
scale
.
These
systems
promise
both
financial
benefits
for
the
institutions
that
use
them
and
potential
conveniences
to
their
customers
.
However
,
they
also
raise
significant
social
,
legal
,
and
technical
questions
that
must
be
resolved
if

systems
for
Electronic

(

)
are
not
to
cause
more
problems
for
the
larger
public
than
they
solve
.
This
paper
examines
the
incentives
for
EFT
developments
and
the
social
problems
they
raise
in
the
context
of
conflicts
between
five
different
value
positions
that
are
often
implicit
in

of

.
These
conflicts
reflect
the
relative
importance
of
certain
problems
for
specific

.
The
value

implicit

help

.W
Conventional
programming
languages
are
growing
ever
more
enormous
,
but
not
stronger
.
Inherent
defects
at
the
most
basic
level
cause
them
to
be
both
fat
and
weak
:
their
primitive
word
-
at
-
a
-
time
style
of
programming
inherited
from
their
common
ancestor
-
the
von
Neumann
computer
,
their
close
coupling
off
semantics
to
state
transitions
,
their
division
of
programming
into
a
world
of
expressions
and
a
world
of
statements
,
their
inability
to
effectively
use
powerful
combining
forms
for
building
new
programs
from
existing
ones
,
and
their
lack
of
useful
mathematical
properties
for
reasoning
about
programs
.
An
alternative
functional
style
of
programming
is
founded
on
the
use
of
combining
forms
for
creating
programs
.
Functional
programs
deal
with
structured
data
,
are
often
nonrepetitive
and
nonrecursive
,
are
hierarchically
constructed
,
do
not
name
their
arguments
,
and
do
not
require
the
complex
machinery
of
procedure
declarations
to
become
generally
applicable
.
Combining
forms
can
use
high
level
programs
to
build
still
higher
level
ones
in
a
style
not
possible
in
conventional
languages
.
Associated
with
the
functional
style
of
programming
is
an
algebra
of
programs
whose
variables
range
over
programs
and
whose
operations
are
combining
forms
.
This
algebra
can
be
used
to
transform
programs
and
to
solve
equations
whose
"
unknowns
"
are
programs
in
much
the
same
way
one
transforms
equations
in
high
school
algebra
.
These
transformations
are
given
by
algebraic
laws
and
are
carried
out
in
the
same
language
in
which
programs
are
written
.
Combining
forms
are
chosen
not
only
for
their
programming
power
but
also
for
the
power
of
their
associated
algebraic
laws
.
General
theorems
of
of
the
algebra
give
the
detailed
behavior
and
termination
conditions
for
large
classes
of
programs
.
A
new
class
of
computing
systems
uses
the
functional
programming
style
both
in
its
programming
language
and
in
its
state
transition
rules
.
Unlike
von
Neumann
languages
,
these
systems
have
semantics
loosely
coupled
to
states
-
only
one
state
transition
occurs
per
major
computation

Shallow
Binding
in
Lisp
1.5
Shallow+Binding
.W
Shallow
binding
is
a
scheme
which
allows
the
value
of
a
variable
to
be
accessed
in
a
bounded
amount
of
computation
.
An
elegant
model
for
shallow
binding
in
Lisp
1.5
is
presented
in
which
context
-
switching
is
an
environment
tree
transformation
called
rerooting
.
Rerooting
is
completely
general
and
reversible
,
and
is
optional
in
the
sense
that
a
Lisp
1.5
interpreter
will
operate
correctly
whether
or
not
rerooting
is
invoked
one
very
context
change
.
Since
rerooting
leaves
assoc
[
v
,
a
]
invariant
,
for
all
variables
v
and
all
environments
a
,
the
programmer
can
have
access
to
a
rerooting
primitive
,
shallow
[
]
,
which
gives
him
dynamic
control
over
whether
accesses
are
shallow
or
deep
,
and
which
affects
only
the
speed
of
execution
of
a
program
,
not
its
semantics
.
In
addition
,
multiple
processes
can
be
active
in
the
same
environment
structure
,
so
long
as
rerooting
is
an
indivisible
operation
.
Finally
,
the
concept
of
rerooting
is
shown
to
combine
the
concept
of
shallow
binding
in
Lisp
with
Dijkstra
's
display
for
Algol
and
hence
is
a
general
model
for
shallow
binding
.

The
concept
of
one
event
happening
before
another
in
a
distributed
system
is
examined
,
and
is
shown
to
define
a
partial

of
the

.
A
distributed
algorithm
is
given
for
synchronizing
a
system
of
logical
clocks
which
can
be
used
to
totally
order
the
events
.
The
use
of
the
total
ordering
is
illustrated
with
a
method
for
solving
synchronization
problems
.
The
algorithm
is
then
specialized
for
synchronizing
physical
clocks
,
and
a
bound
is
derived
on
how
far
out
of
synchrony
the
clocks
can
become
.

This

presents
pseudochaining
as
a
new
collision
-
resolution
method
.
Pseudochaining
is
half
way
between
open
addressing
and
chaining
.
It
owes
its
name
to
the
fact
that
link
fields
are
present
in
each
cell
of
the
hash
table
which
permits
"
chaining
"
of
the

The

is
a
method
of

by
using
the

In

for
detecting

recovering
from

in

The
scheme
,
which
is
based
on

,
is
driven
by
information
which
is
directly
and
automatically
obtainable
from
the
information

is
already

The

appears
to
provide
error

which

.W
This
paper
describes
an
approach
for
determining
the
minimum
,
maximum
,
and
average
times
to
parse
sentences
acceptable
by
a
deterministic
parser
.
These
quantities
are
presented
in
the
form
of
symbolic
formulas
,
called
time
-
formulas
.
The
variables
in
these
formulas
represent
not
only
the
length
of
the
input
string
but
also
the
time
to
perform
elementary
operations
such
as
pushing
,
popping
,
subscripting
,
iterating
,
etc
.
By
binding
to
the
variables
actual
numerical
values
corresponding
to
a
given
compiler
-
machine
configuration
,
one
can
determine
the
execution
time
for
that
configuration
.
Time
-
formulas
are
derived
by
examining
the
grammar
rules
and
the
program
representing
the
algorithm
one
wishes
to
analyze
.
The
approach
is
described
by
using
a
specific

The
problem
of
selecting

items
from
a
binary
search
tree
according
to
a
list
of
range
conditions
is
considered
.
The
process
of
visiting
a
minimal
number
of
nodes
to
retrieve
data
satisfying
the
range
conditions
is
called
selective
traversal
.
Presented
in
this
paper
is
an
algorithm
for
selective
traversal
which
uses
a
tag
field
for
each
node
in
the
tree
.
The
algorithm
is
particularly
useful
and
efficient
when
examination
of
data
is
more
time
consuming
than
examination
of
a
tag
field
.

An

A
one

tree
is
a
binary
tree
in
which
every
node
's
right
subtree
has
a
height
which
is
equal
to
or
exactly
one
greater
than
the
height
of
its
left
subtree
.
It
has
an
advantage
over
the
more
general
AVL
tree
in
that
only
one
bit
of
balancing
information
is
required
(
two
bits
are
required
for
the

)
.
It
is
shown
that
deletion
of
an
arbitrary
node
of
such
a

can
be
accomplished
in
O
(

operations
,
where
n

Moreover
the

that
its

in

only

Optimal
Shift
Strategy
for
a
Block

Transfer
CCD
Memory
Optimal+Shift
Shift+Strategy
Transfer+CCD
CCD+Memory
.W
For
the
purposes
of
this
paper
,
a
block
-
transfer
CCD
memory
is
composed
of
serial
shift
registers
whose
shift
rate
can
vary
,
but
which
have
a
definite
minimum
shift
rate
(
the
refresh
rate
)
and
a
definite
maximum
shift
rate
.
The
bits
iin
the
shift
registers
are
numbered
0
to
N
-
1
,
and
blocks
of
N
bits
are
always
transferred
,
always
starting
at
bit
0
.
What
is
the
best
shift
strategy
so
that
a
block
transfer
request
occurring
at
a
random
time
will
have
to
wait
the
minimal
amount
of
time
before
bit
0
can
be
reached
?
The
minimum
shift
rate
requirement
does
not
allow
one
to
simply
"
park
"
at
bit
0
and
wait
for
a
transfer
request
.
The
optimal
strategy
involves
shifting
as
slowly
as
possible
until
bit
0
is
passed
,
then
shifting
as
quickly
as
possible
until
a
critical
boundary
is
reached
,
shortly
before
bit
0
comes
around
again
.
This
is
called
the
"
hurry
up
and
wait
"
strategy
and
is
well
known
outside
the
computer
field
.
The
block

This

integrated
procedure
mechanism
that
permits
procedures
to
be
used

.
This
integration
is
accomplished
by
treating
procedures
and
their
activation
records
(
called
environments
)
as
data
objects
and
by
decomposing
procedure
invocation
into
three
separate
components
at

.W
The
use
of
several
levels
of
abstraction
has
proved
to
be
very
helpful
in
constructing
and
maintaining
programs
.
When
programs
are
designed
with
abstract
data
types
such
as
sets
and
lists
,
programmer
time
can
be
saved
by
automating
the
process
of
filling
in
low
-
level
implementation
details
.
In
the
past
,
programming
systems
have
provided
only
a
single
general
purpose
implementation
for
an
abstract
type
.
Thus
the
programs
produced
using
abstract
types
were
then
inefficient
in
space
or
time
.
In
this
paper
a
system
for
automatically
choosing
efficient
implementations
for
abstract
types
from
a
library
of
implementations
is
discussed
.
This
process
is
discussed
in
detail
for
an
example
program
.
General
issues
in
data

selection
are
also
reviewed

Controlled
sharing
of
information
is
needed
and
desirable
for
many
applications
and
is
supported
in
operating
systems
by
access
control
mechanisms
.
This
paper
shows
how
to
extend
programming
languages
to
provide
controlled
sharing
.
The
extension
permits
expression
of
access
constraints
on
shared
data
.
Access
constraints
can
apply
both
to
simple
objects
,
and
to
objects
that
are
components
of
larger

,
such
as
bank
account
records
in
a

.
The
constraints
are
stated
declaratively
,
and
can
be
enforced
by
static
checking
similar
to
type
checking
.
The
approach
can
be
used
to
extend
any

,
but
is
particularly
suitable
for
extending

that

Many

whose

depend
on
the
distance
from
a

This

An

for
the

which
the

is
either

According
to
traditional
conceptions
of
cryptographic
security
,
it
is
necessary
to
transmit
a
key
,
by
secret
means
,
before
encrypted
messages
can
be
sent
securely
.
This
paper
shows
that
it
is
possible
to
select
a
key
over
open
communications
channels
in
such
a
fashion
that
communications
security
can
be
maintained
.
A
method
is
described
which
forces
any
enemy
to
expend
an
amount
of
work
which
increases
as
the
square
of
the
work
required
of
the
two
communicants
to
select
the
key
.
The
method
provides
a
logically
new
kind
of
protection
against
the
passive

.
It
suggests
that
further
research
on
this
topic
will
be
highly

,
both
in
a
theoretical

a
practical
sense

)
is
bounded
by
a
(
small
)
constant
.
Classical
implementations
of
list
processing
systems
lack
this
property
because
allocating
a
list
cell
from
the
heap
may
cause
a
garbage
collection
,
which
process
requires
time
proportional
to
the
heap
size
to
finish
.
A
real

list

system
is
presented
which
continuously
reclaims
garbage
,
including
directed
cycles
,
while
linearizing
and
compacting
the
accessible
cells
into
contiguous
locations
to
avoid
fragmenting
the
free
storage
pool
.
The
program
is
small
and
requires
no
time
-
sharing
interrupts
,
making
it
suitable
for
microcode
.
Finally
,
the
system
requires
the
same
average
time
,
and
not
more
than
twice
the

those

Isolating+Differences

.W
A
simple
algorithm
is
described
for
isolating
the
differences
between
two
files
.
One
application
is
the
comparing
of
two
versions
of
a
source
program
or
other
file
in
order
to
display
all
differences
.
The
algorithm
isolates
differences
in
a
way
that
corresponds
closely
to
our
intuitive
notion
of
difference
,
is
easy
to
implement
,
and
is
computationally
efficient
,
with
time
linear
in
the
file
length
.
For
most
applications
the
algorithm
isolates
differences
similar
to
those
isolated
by
the
longest
common
subsequence
.
Another
application
of
this
algorithm
merges
files
containing
independently
generated
changes
into
a
single
file
.
The
algorithm
can
also
be
used
to
generate
efficient
encodings
of
a
file
in
the
form
of
the
differences
between
itself
and
a

Due

difficulties

arise

These
difficulties
occur
when
an
entity
cannot
be
processed
because
of
a
forward
reference
to
information
only
obtainable
from
subsequent
entities
.
Classic
solutions
ask
for

appropriate
for

A
technique
is
presented
here
which
uses
instead
control
structures
,

events

processes
.
The
work
of
the
compiler
-
writer
becomes
easier
both
conceptually
and
in
practice
because
he
can
forget
these
problems
at
the

and
he
avoids
special
processing
for

problem

technique

A
mathematical
study
of
three
approaches
for
defining
nested
arrays
in
APL
is
presented
.
Theorems
exhibiting
the
relationships
between
the
definitional
systems
are
given
and
illustrated
through
graph

.
One
of
the
approaches
is
used
to
define
an
APL
array
to
be
a
recursive
data
structure
equivalent
to
a
tree
structure
in
which
all
data
is
stored
at
the
leaves
as
homogeneous
arrays
of
numbers
and
characters
.
An
extension
of
APL
is
proposed
that
includes
new
primitive
functions
to
manipulate
the
nesting
level
of
arrays
and
new
operators
to
assist
in

Global
Optimization

Global+Optimization

.W
The
elimination
of

and
the
moving
of
invariant
computations
out
of
loops
are
often
done
separately
,
with
invariants
moved
outward

by
loop
.
We
propose
to
do
both
at
once
and
to
move
each
expression
directly
to
the
entrance
of
the
outermost
loop
in
which
it
is
invariant
.
This
is
done
by
solving
a
more

problem
,
i

e
.
the
elimination
of
computations
performed
twice
on
a
given
execution
path
.
Such
computations
are
termed
partially

.
Moreover
,
the
algorithm
does
not
require
any
graphical
information
or
restrictions
on
the
shape
of
the
program
graph
.
Testing
this
algorithm
has
shown
that
its
execution
cost
is
nearly
linear
with
the
size
of
the
program
,
and
that
it
leads
to
a
smaller

that

less

Synchronization
with
Eventcounts
and
Sequencers
.W
Synchronization
of
concurrent
processes
requires
controlling
the
relative
ordering
of
events
in
the
processes
.
A
new
synchronization
mechanism
is
proposed
,
using
abstract
objects
called
eventcounts
and
sequencers
,
that
allows
processes
to
control
the
ordering
of
events
directly
,
rather
than
using
mutual
exclusion
to
protect
manipulations
of
shared
variables
that
control
ordering
of
events
.
Direct
control
of
ordering
seems
to
simplify
correctness
arguments
and
also
simplifies
implementation
in
distributed
systems
.
The
mechanism
is
defined
formally
,
and
then
several
examples
of
its
use
are
given
.
The
relationship
of
the
mechanism
to
protection
mechanisms
in
the
system
is
explained
;
in
particular
,
eventcounts
are
shown
to
be
applicable
to
situations
where
confinement
of
information
matters
.
An
implementation
of
eventcount
s
and
sequencers
in
a
system
with
shared

is
described

a

to
have
an
algorithm
finding
hyperplanes
which
separates
the
two

The
traditional

find
a
hyperplane
which
separates
all

in
the
other
,
but
such
a
hyperplane
is
not
necessarily
centered
in
the
empty
space
between
the
two
classes
.
Since
a
central
hyperplane
does
not
favor
one
class
or
the
other
,
it
should
have
a
lower
error
rate
in
classifying
new

better
than
a

An

for
detecting
occurrences
of
a
three
-
dimensional
pattern
of
objects
within
a
larger
structure
is
presented
.
The
search
technique
presented
uses
the
geometric
structure
of
the
pattern
to
define
characteristics
demanded
of
candidates
for
matching
.
This
is
useful
in
cases
where
the
properties
of
each
atom
,
considered
individually
,
do
not
adequately
limit
the
number
of
sets
of
possible
matchings
.
Several
applications
of
this
technique
in
the
field
of
chemistry
are
:
(

in

:

An
efficient
and
numerically
stable
method
is
presented
for
the
problem
of
updating
an
orthogonal
decomposition
of
a
matrix
of
column
(
or
row
)
vectors
.
The
fundamental
idea
is
to
add
a
column
(
or
row
)
analogous
to
adding
an
additional
row
of
data
in
a
linear
least
squares
problem
.
A
column
(
or
row
)
is
dropped
by
a
formal
scaling
with
the
imaginary
unit
,
-
1
,
followed
by
least
squares
addition
of
the
column
(
or
row
)
.
The
elimination
process
for
the
procedure
is
successive
ssive
application
of
the
Givens
transformation
in
modified
(
more
efficient
)
form
.
These
ideas
are
illustrated
with
an
implementation
of
the
revised
simplex
method
.
The
algorithm
is
a
general
purpose
one
that
does
not
account
for
any
particular
structure
or
sparsity
in
the
equations
.
Some
suggested
computational
tests
for
determining
signs
of

controlling

in

are

is
an

of

to
find

How
many

How

corrected

What

What
can

approximately
40

As
computer
technology
matures
,
our
growing
ability
to
create
large
systems
is
leading
to
basic
changes
in
the
nature
of
programming
.
Current
programming
language
concepts
will
not
be
adequate
for
building
and
maintaining
systems
of
the
complexity
called
for
by
the
tasks
we
attempt
.
Just
as
high
level
languages
enabled
the
programmer
to
escape
from
the
intricacies
of
a
machine
's
order
code
,
higher
level
programming
systems
can
provide
the
means
to
understand
and
manipulate
complex
systems
and
components
.
In
order
to
develop
such
systems
,
we
need
to
shift
our
attention
away
from
the
detailed
specification
of
algorithms
,
towards
the
description
of
the
properties
of
the
packages
and
objects
with
which
we
build
.
This
paper
analyzes
some
of
the
shortcomings
of
programming
languages
as
they
now
exist
,
and
lays
out
some
possible
directions
for
future
research

In
order
to
multiply
matrices
while
minimizing
the
number
of
page
fetches
required
,
it
is
often
more
efficient
to
reorganize
the
data
into
submatrix
form
and
to
use
block
multiplication
rather
than
to
use
the
best
known
algorithms
which
leave
the
matrices
stored
in
row
-
(
or

)
oriented

.
An
efficient
method
for
accomplishing
this
reorganization
is
given
.
This
also
makes
possible
the
derivation
of
an
asymptotically
better
bound
for
multiplication
of

given
in

by
adapting
the

.W
The
possibility
of
giving
different
quality
of
service
to
jobs
of
different
classes
by
regulating
their
memory
allocation
is
examined
in
the
context
of
a
paged
computer
system
.
Two
parameterized
algorithms
which
partition
the
main
memory
between
two
classes
of
jobs
are
considered
.
Initially
,
a
closed
system
consisting
of
a
process
or
and
paging
and
file
devices
,
with
fixed
numbers
of
jobs
,
is
studied
to
determine
optimal
degrees
of
multiprogramming
and
the
proportion
of
processor
time
devoted
to
each
class
.
Applying
a
decomposition
approach
and
treating
the
closed
system
as
a
single
server
,
the
response
times
in
an
open
system
with
external
arrivals
are
studied
.
The
object
is
to
investigate
the
effect
of
the
memory
alocation
parameters
on
the
expected
response

under
the
two
algorithms
.
Numerical
solutions
and
economical
lower
bounds
for
the

the

are
obtained

A

Algorithm

Logic

.W
An
algorithm
can
be
regarded
as
consisting
of
a
logic
component
,
which
specifies
the
knowledge
to
be
used
in
solving
problems
,
and
a
control
component
,
which
determines
the
problem
-
solving
strategies
by
means
of
which
that
knowledge
is
used
.
The
logic
component
determines
the
meaning
of
the
algorithm
whereas
the
control
component
only
affects
its
efficiency
.
The
efficiency
of
an
algorithm
can
often
by
improving
the
control
component
without
changing
the
logic
of
the
algorithm
.
We
argue
that
computer
programs
would
be
more
often
correct
and
more
easily
improved
and
modified
if
their
logic
and
control
aspects
were
identified

Proving
Termination
with
Multiset
Orderings
Proving+Termination
Multiset+Orderings
.W
A
common
tool
for
proving
the
termination
of
programs
is
the
well
-
founded
set
,
a
set
ordered
in
such
a
way
as
to
admit
no
infinite
descending
sequences
.
The
basic
approach
is
to
find
a
termination
function
that
maps
the
values
of
the
program
variables
into
some
well
-
founded
set
,
such
that
the
value
of
the
termination
function
is
repeatedly
reduced
throughout
the
computation
.
All
too
often
,
the
termination
functions
required
are
difficult
to
find
and
are
of
a
complexity
out
of
proportion
to
the
program
under
consideration
.
Multisets
(
bags
)
over
a
given
well
-
founded
set
S
are
sets
that
admit
multiple
occurrences
of
elements
taken
from
S
.
The
given
ordering
on
S
induces
an
ordering
on
the
finite
multisets
over
S
.
This
multiset
ordering
is
shown
to
be
well
-
founded
.
The
multiset
ordering
enables
the
use
of
relatively
simple
and
intuitive
termination
functions
in
otherwise
difficult
termination
proofs
.
In
particular
,
the
multiset
ordering
is
used
to
prove
the
termination
of
production
systems
,
programs
defined
in
terms
of
sets
of
rewriting

An
algorithm
for
inserting
an
element
into
a
one
-
sided
height
-
balanced
(
OSHB
)
binary
search
tree
is
presented
.
The
algorithm
operates
in
time
O
(
log
n
)
,
where
n
is
the
number
of
nodes
in
the
tree
.
This
represents
an
improvement
over
the
best
previous
ly
known
insertion
algorithms
of
Hirschberg
and
Kosaraju
,
which
require
time
O
(
log
2n
)
.
Moreover
,
the
O
(
log
n
)
complexity
is
optimal
.
Earlier
results
have
shown
that
deletion
in
such
a
structure
can
also
be
performed
in
O
(
log
n
)
time
.
Thus
the
result
of
this
paper
gives
a
negative
answer
to
the
question
of
whether
such
trees
should
be
the
first
examples
of
their
kind
,
where
deletion
has
a
smaller
time
complexity
than
insertion
.
Furthermore
,
it
can
now
be
concluded
that
insertion
,
deletion
,
and
retrieval
in
OSHB
trees
can
be
performed
in
the
same
time
as
the
corresponding
operations
for
the
more
general
AVL
trees
,
to
within
a
constant
factor
.
However
,
the
insertion
and
deletion
algorithms
for
OSHB
trees
appear
much
more
complicated
than
the
corresponding
algorithms
for
AVL
trees
.

The
approximation
of
polygonal
thematic
maps
by
cellular
maps
,
an
important
operation
in
geographical
data
processing
,
is
analyzed
.
The
data
organization
used
for
representing
the
polygonal
maps
is
a
widely
used
segment
-
based
data
structure
,
where
class
labels
identify
the
regions
bordering
each
segment
on
either
side
.
The
approximation
algorithm
presented
operates
on
such
an
organization
,
eliminating
the
need
for
the
recognition
of

.
Each
segment
is

The
versatility
of
the
new
organization
is
further

The

hypothesis
that

are
provided
greater
accuracy
and
freedom
from
error
and
fraud

electronic
funds
transfer
systems
(
EFTs

computer
to
protect
against
both
accidentally
and
intentionally
caused
losses
.
Although
the
nomenclature
for
business
crimes
remains
the
same

manual
depository
and
other
financial
service
systems
-
for
example
,
fraud
,
theft
,
embezzlement
-
the
characteristics
of
the

are
new
.
The
changes
resulting
from
the
accelerating
use
of
EFTs
and
its
continual
technological
advances
broaden
the
scope
of
security
issues
to
be
examined
.
Factors
such
