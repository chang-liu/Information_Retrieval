SECTION A
"""
0.  Folder [classes] is the included both self-added class and the original classes comes with the homeword.

1.  I added a class named [thethatthen] that for special NEOS cases under the folder [classes] (classes\thethatthen).

2.  I actually have 2 files for Section A that used different methods to solve the problem:
    in [section1.prl] I hand crafted 20 rules which evaluates the training data at 99.88%;
    in [section1_weka_PART.prl] I used weka and PART classifier to generate 7 rules which evaluates the training data at 99.64%;
    I am not sure which way is the better way to solve the section A, so I just made 2 versions.
    You may want to run both of the scripts on the test data to check which one will perform better ...
    
3.  To run the perl script, you may want to modify the class folder path at line 13 in file [section1.prl] and/or [section1_weka_PART.prl] : $L="classes";

4.  Use command 'section1.prl < sent.data.train | more' and/or 'section1_weka_PART.prl < sent.data.train | more' to run the scripts.

5.  [section1.prl]: after running it, it will generate 2 files: [section1_prl_result.txt] has all the output and performance of the script. [invalid_rule.txt] has all the unmatched sentences.
    [section1_weka_PART.prl]: after running it, it will generate 2 files: [section1_weka_PART_result.txt] has all the output and performance of the script. [invalid_rule_weka_PART.txt] has all the unmatched sentences.

6.  [section1_weka_generator.prl] is used to generate the weka .arff file [sentence.arff]. (Use: 'section1_weka_generator.prl < sent.data.train | more')

7.  [sentence.arff] is the .arff file that used for constructing the weka version of my answer: [section1_weka_PART.prl]

8.  [sent.data.train] is the training data file

9.  \results folder has the final results of my 2 scripts' performance on the training data.

10.  \other folder has my [section1_weka_JRip.prl] which is weka with JRip classifier. It has a bad performance so I didn't use it. I just attached it for your reference.
